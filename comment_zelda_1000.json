    "quote": "For Tears of the Kingdom, my experience playing through the game has been bad.  I have nothing against TotK using the same map as BotW but with 2 added landscape to explore, the sky and depths.  Exploring the world of TotK seems rewarding at first, but it starts getting old too fast and the only reward is just seeing the sites.  You still have to find hundreds of Korok seeds to expand your weapon, bows, and shields inventories to functional levels.  There are physical dungeons, but they don't hold the charm as the traditional Zelda games achieved.\n\nThe most important factors of any game is the content and how you play in it.  The content is more quantity than quality.  The gameplay feels good if you have plenty of resources to burn through.  Finding great weapons is a bit more difficult in TotK than BotW due to new mechanics from the Zonai technology.  To incentivize using the fusion mechanic, weapons have lower durability than they had in BotW.  As long as you have decent fusion material, you can make \"decent\" weapons, but for me, that fusion material pool is used for too much, and this led to terrible experiences with combat.  If I want a better time dealing with tough encounters, it involved spending hours in the depths farming for bombs and materials.\n\nOverall, the game play is more punishing than Dark Souls type games.  If this is the future of Zelda games, the series is doomed.",

This doesn't suit the serious (imo) ... Breath of the Wild was overrated for what was offered, I don't recommend these two games as representative of what a true Zelda game is. Majora's Mask, Twilight Princess, Ocarina of Time even Skyward Sword does Zelda justice not this. There's open world and then there's overcooked... Been a fan since Ocarina its a shame to see my interest in Zelda drop almost completely. I like Rauru and the whole cast its just overshadowed by gameplay that is laughable, creative but too cartoonish and overall without a sense of honour and direction",

Y para agregar m\u00e1s, se agregaron las islas en el cielo, un subsuelo igual de grande que el mapa original, y una red cientos de cuevas y cientos de pozos en el mapa original. Las f\u00edsicas, a su vez, complementan a las habilidades y el mapa, siendo extremadamente detalladas y retroactivas. Hay tantas cosas para decir sobre este juego, pero intent\u00e9 resumirlo en un p\u00e1rrafo. Simplemente alucinante en todos los aspectos (incluso la m\u00fasica y la direcci\u00f3n de arte por dios!), y uno de los mejores, sino el mejor juego de la historia. 15/10",

Its story is even more compelling than its predecessor, your new abilities are game-altering with tons of player-agency, and the world is somehow even more massive and ACTUALLY FILLED WITH THINGS TO DO than it was before.

The change of Magnesis where you can only move magnetic items to Ultrahand where you can move any free item is great. Each playthrough is unique and there is so much to explore. So much to explore is the only downside. (Also the sages abilities, I MISS YOU REVALI'S GALE). You might be thinking to yourself \"How is too much exploration a downside?\". The reason is that you need an online guide if you want to get 100%. Finding everything on your own would take years. Love this game, 10/10.",

The side quests are more fun as well. Combat has quality of life improvements. The hand abilities are a lot better than BotW's shekiah slate powers. Ultrahand lets me mess around in all kinds of new ways, like driving across large stretches of land, and kill monsters in new ways. Fuse fixed the weapon durability problem. There is one weakness in gameplay: the sage abilities are more gimmicky and less practical (exception being the wind one). The story is an improvement over BotW (mainly due to the tear memories, rather than Link's own quest) but still a bit lacking. The dungeons are decent, with proper elemental themes returning, as well as unique bosses (rather than the boring Blight Ganons in BotW). The finale is pure greatness, and Ganondorf has had his best showing to date.",

The new abilities are great, like making Zonai creations or reversing an object back at the enemy. The map is better too with the ability to explore the skies and the depths. However, I think this game will not have the same effect as it's predesscor due to it being maybe \"too similar\" by many.",

    "quote": "Since the release of BOTW, we never thought it could be beaten, never mind matched. However, Tears Of The Kingdom undoubtedly improves on virtually every single aspect of the game, from the core gameplay its self, to minor details within the game, truly defining it as the greatest game OF ALL TIME. \n\nFirstly, Tears of the Kingdom drastically improves upon the dungeons seem within Breath Of The Wild. Although the divine beasts were very good, they felt repetitive, and each one felt like a slight reskin of the other. However, in Tears Of The Kingdom we see a more traditional and unique style to the temples, each fitting their respective areas. The lightning temple, a prime example of how great the temples are, feels much more like a traditional dungeon with rooms throughout the dungeon connecting to each other to form a sensational sequence of puzzles to finish the temple. Furthermore, the journey to the temple itself is sensational, truly setting up the marvel of the temple to come. To further improve upon BOTW, the bosses are drastically improved. The fights are thrilling, entertaining and truly enhance the dungeon further. They are completely unique which makes it feel all the more special. \n\nSecondly, the new abilities introduced truly enhance the gaming experience. Firstly, fuse is essential to fixing the durability problem. Instead of looking for the weapons themselves, fuse allows us to create our own weapons which mean that we are focused upon the materials not the weapons. Ascend allows us to efficiently ascend through ceilings, hills, caves in order to reach another place, almost like revali\u2019s gale. Recall is just out-right amazing. And ultra hand completely revolutionises Tears Of The Kingdom. It allows us to create and tackle the game in what ever way we want, eradication the linear aspect to any puzzle and the game in general. It brings the players imagination to life and truly changes the gameplay experience, making it better than ever. \n\nThirdly, the story of TOTK is more in-depth and meaningful than before. Characters like Zelda are more developed and truly feel essential to the plot. It is all a mystery at first, and engages the reader as we slowly unveil the mystery. And, of course, the introduction of Ganondorf is genius, adding a deceitful, thrilling and powerful antagonist to the plot and giving us the greatest Zelda boss fight ever, and the greatest cinematic ending to a game in history. \n\nFinally, the introduction of the sky Islands and The Depths eradicate the emptiness of breath of the Wild and give us a more jam packed Hyrule. Everywhere you go, there is always a new puzzle, challenge or mystery to the game, perfecting the open world genre. \n\nTears Of The Kingdom doesn\u2019t revolutionise open world gaming, but perfects it and improves upon one the greatest games of all time. It is truly a masterpiece and a must get for any player of any console.",

    "quote": "When people said BOTW was fun, creative, and limitless it was a flat-out lie. However, TOTK brings this duology more justice as it adds tons of new gameplay elements, more original combat, and better traversal. At its core it does remain the same though the story runs a little bit deeper which is certainly appreciated. Unfortunately, the gameplay does get boring and repetitive quickly, especially if you played BOTW. \n\nIf you were questioning wether you needed to play the prequel before this, the answer is NO most definitely not, go straight to TOTK and never look back!\n\nPLAY AND JUDGE",

Tears of the Kingdom's gameplay, despite borrowing plenty from it's predecessor, Breath of the Wild, expands on the amazing foundation with amazing gameplay, a world that is still fun to explore and satisfying puzzles.\n\nHowever, the game's story fails to satisfy is many areas, the memories, unlike Breath of the Wild, are intended to be viewed in a certain order, which is not made clear to the player. This leads to the story being extremely boring and predicable if you view it in any way other than what is intended. The dungeons, while a vast upgrade from that of Breath of the Wild, have unsatisfying pay offs with all 4 being largely the same. This is a shame, as the series is largely known for it's grande and amazing stories. \n\nHowever, the story is still better than many other game, and the new features such as the depths provide many hours of exploration and enjoyment. However, the sky, shown all across advertising, failed to impress, as many are mere copies of each other and the are too disconnected from each other outside of the tutorial area.\n\nHighly recommend, as it is a game where the flaws simply do not outweigh the extraordinary majority of the game",

The world? Huge. The map is now in three layers, all about the same size as the map in BotW. Game play? Hmm, weeeeell it's basically the same as BotW but with some small changes (and larger changes that you don't really need). It feels more like a DLC or even a MOD than a new stand-alone game. Would I recommend it? Yes and no. Buy it on sale, but we all know Nintendo doesn't do sale on big games.",

There's too much dialogue, the UI ****, the sky islands are barren, the cutscenes for the dungeons are boring, etc. etc. etc. But all these flaws completely fail to ruin my experience with the game. \n\nThis game gave me an emotion that no other game could have given me. I don't want to do a spoiler review but I can write so much about it. Some of my favorite moments in not only Zelda but gaming history, come from this game and it took me 150 hours to finally decide to fight Ganon. And the ending was... simply fantastic.\n\nMaybe I'm biased or my love for the franchise blinds me to its flaws, but I have not had this much fun with a game since Mario Odyssey nor Celeste.\n\nI don't want to write more. Just know, there are critiques one could give the game, but the highest of highs remain here and I wouldn't trade this experience for anything.\n\nI wondered before what Breath of the Wild was missing when I played that game. It wasn't the weaker abilities; it wasn't the lackluster ending; it wasn't the empty Hyrule. It was one thing: a heart. The charisma and wit of Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, and Skyward Sword were missing in Breath of the Wild. This game has it.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom... has it all. If they just tweaked a few more things and I'd give this a perfect rating",

In many ways it is the game BoTW should have been.\n\nI almost see BoTW as a sort of beta version of ToTK. It is as if the creation of the open world and game mechanics took so much time and resources that the developers did not have time to actually fill the world with content or a story. With ToTK I feel like the mechanics and open world concept was already developed, so now they were able to focus solely on filling the world with content and a richer storyline. \n\nToTK is a true pleasure to play. It is a great game with lots of fun and so much to explore.",

Biggest complaints, barren sky and underground, overall game play is easy, cooking and clothing become fairly useless as most of it doesnt do anything that is actually needed to complete the game, and worst of all the very short and low difficulty in the dungeons. I would go for a smaller world that has more content, or missions that give meaningful rewards or add to the \"must do's\" to move forward or access other new content . So the game gets a 7 because it's not fair to score too low because it is well-made, but definitely not a 10 because it is not far off from breath of the wild.",

I quickly adapt into the world legend of Zelda (of course with the help of communities posts and walkthroughs) and I find that ToTK have its own unique system that makes it different from BoTW. Though, I'd say that my way of playing is reversed. If anyone wants to start playing Zelda in Nintendo switch, the correct order is BoTW then ToTK since they just differs in timeline.",

The boss was actually very good and just for the boss 4 points. Botw was way better",

    "quote": "This game is great and all but for me this game is not even an action game, this game is just open world puzzle game. You find a shrine, it is a puzzle, to get korok seeds solve a puzzle, even finding out what to do for quests are puzzles. Even boss fights are puzzle and I hated that. Dude let me fight these mfs normally but no first you have to shoot its eye and then you can deal the damage, no you have beat 3 heads first and then you can deal the damage, otherwise they are just spamming their **** and they dont give you proper time to deal some damage. The most fair fights are lynels and they are fun and challenging. The others are just feel like you are solving puzzle over and over again and I am sick of it. Give me proper boss fights. Another problem is armor. I upgraded my armor to the highest and I didn't see the difference and it's same with weapons. At the beginning of the game I was wearing weapons with 10-15 attack and after some time it increased to 50 but I still didn't feel the difference. It didn't make me feel like, oh this weapon is strong... So this kind of things killed the mood for me... And to be honest, I feel bored 80% of the time. Because the game mechanics that are supposed to entertain you are just puzzles. Even the action itself is a puzzle, but it is supposed to be dynamic.\nAnyway that's the all the complains that I have. But I understand why it has such a high score and people think it is a masterpiece and all but it is not like that for me, still a great game though.",

The core formula has already become stale as it is basically identical to BotW. Totk does basically nothing to address the many of the problems discovered in BotW. While I\u2019m very impressed by what Totk has accomplished, I know that the future of Zelda must recognize its loyal \u201cclassic\u201d fans in order to maintain its status as one of the greatest gaming series. The Zelda team should analyze why some Zelda fans are worried for the franchise\u2019s future.",

Ultrahand, fuse, and ascend open up so many possibilities and allow for creativity. This makes moving around the map and solving puzzles much more satisfying.

All the Chests you get, have useless stuff in them, just another batch of bow/sword/shield... put them to the 50 other ones in your inventory. Having to walk to my next destination scared me more than Ganondorf and his lackeys and you know whats worse? now you get the same empty useless world in the sky and in the depths.\nThe Whole game felt like a chore to play. Just finished it at around 65h, not gonna continue or play the sidequests.\n\nPro:\n- Crafting variety is huge, some ppl will love to build machines etc. (not me)\n- gameplay is nice, swordplay and bow etc. is great\n-love the coloring of the game\n- interesting characters including both mcs and villain\n\ncon:\n- cant call your horse from more than 20 meters. not gonna buy any dlc for that tbh, nintendo has to learn to build in quality of life features (they are probably scared that it would cut the playtime short if you were on horseback all the time)\n- weapon durability\n- weapons overall,  mastersword is probably the biggest joke ever.\nthe only good weapons in the game are either limited or have big debuffs... is that supposed to be fun?\n- tedious sidequests, like unlocking the fairies for equipment enchancment (they should beat the guy up who came up with that idea)\n- equipment enchancement costs too much, 4x upgradeable, costs 10, 50, 200, 500, so760 just for 1 piece + rare materials (so selling them is not an option, they should also beat up that guy, but is probably the same dude), 2280 rupees for just 1 set of clothing to max and there are above 15 or so sets.\n- farming money/rupees is almost impossible and goes too slow, quests reward you max with 300, the gems are way to scarce and are needed for upgrading or weapon buff\n- shrines are harder to find compared to botw, wasnt fun to look for them, not gonna open a gameguide for that\n- depths are just pure suffering. cant see more than 5 meters ahead, gloom everywhere and mobs that either put gloom on you or oneshot you... the whole idea is nice but the realization is so bad.\n- Dragontear quests should be fixed, so that you get the videos in order, mine were all over the place. so i was confused till i stopped playing and watched the whole video in order on youtube. that way i could spoil myself and also have atleast some clue what was going on\n- damage scaling is very bad. i was hitting like a truck with my 70+ dmg weapon but still couldnt scratch the silver class monsters, burned many good weapons on some random mobs\n- the game is trying too hard to be mysterious .. i dont want to explore everything, give me a clear line, show me where i have to go, where i can find the caves etc., the world is too big and everything looks similar so i dont wanna go to most of those places and explore them\n\ni enjoyed the game but it had moments where i absolutely hated it.\ni am glad that i played it, but i will def not preorder the next zelda title thankts to this game",

The only downside in my opinion is the game overstays its welcome slightly. You have to do something major before fighting Ganon that drags out the story another 5 hours. Other than that the game is a must play imo.",

    "quote": "It irons out almost all of BotW's weaknesses.GOOD:- Gigantic open world with lots of secrets and unique caves.- A comprehensible story with an epic climax, albeit very predictable.- GANONDORF IS BACK! The final battle is epic, but simple. This is probably the way to pick up casuals and veterans alike.- The skills! Weaponfuse as well as building vehicles is great! Crafting weapons in particular is great fun. There aren't too many special fusions in the end, but it solves the problem that BotW still had. Battles are motivating. You are well rewarded and make noticeable progress without a level system.AVERAGE:- Timeback Skill - is very helpful, but also necessary in places to rewind the far-flying parts that didn't land where you physically expected them to.- Bosses - they're still not as good as they were in previous Zelda instalments, but better than the Ganon fights in ****:- Enemy Variation. BotW already had few enemies, but TotK simply has too few enemies for a game in 2023. Only a handful of new ones have been added. I would have liked more creative enemies here, especially because of Weaponfuse.- Dungeons. Someone says that the great dungeons of the good Zelda days have returned. I can't confirm that. The 4 story dungeons are even worse than the Divine Beasts. The fire and water temples in particular are just areas stuck together with no depth. The worst dungeons Zelda has ever had.- Sky Islands: Of all things, the main focus of the marketing is the weakest area in the entire game. It's more a question of how you get up there. Once you're up there, one of three copy-paste patterns awaits the player. Boring. On top of that, there is a pathetic variety of enemies up here. There are really only the small robots and maybe the occasional flying enemy.- Underground. Provides strong kicks for the first 3 hours. Then it becomes just as trivially boring as the Sky **** GO:- There's nothing worse for an open world than copying the world from the previous instalment and barely reworking it. There are caves, which are the best innovation on the surface. Everything else in the familiar open world is a bitter disappointment. Exploration is no fun. Worse still: where there was nothing in BotW, there is often nothing to be found in TotK either. So the open world degenerates even more into an Ubisoft junk world.TLDR: A masterpiece that fails due to its open world formula and doesn't make the most of its cool game design ideas.",

That was BotW innovation. TotK fails to understand this on a fundamental level to such a degree that we might even start to think BotW was a fluke. \n\nBeyond that, TotK's new mechanics actually negatively impact BotW's other major innovation: world interaction. Because, you no longer have to think about the terrain when you can just Ascend past it all or build a flying machine to bypass it all. It's kind of amazing how little they considered BotW when making this game.\n\nThen, there's the story, which tries to pretend all other Zelda games never existed.

What happened to the 4 races of hyrule? What changed? As you explore the surface of Hyrule, you never run out of questions to ask. The depths, and the sky islands, nurture this constant sense of curiosity, drawing your eyes to them, perhaps not acting as second and third maps, but rather like additional locations on the original map, fueling your imagination and curiosity. While the rewards at the end of the trail these questions lead you on may not necessarily be the best or most useful, what is fulfilling is the journey, the act of travelling, the anticipation, and the discovery along the way itself. Along with the constant discovery and exploration, there were some of the highest highlights along the way. This game is the king of setting the mood. The sounds, the atmosphere, and the visuals of the Lightning Temple, Wind Temple and Fire Temple set the mood in the best way possible, getting you ready to take on the puzzles, enemies and bosses.\n\nThis game nails the *feeling* of exploration, wonder, and curiosity, enhanced by the gorgeous artstyle and mood setting. This, is what sets this game apart, and this is what makes this game a 10/10 for me, despite all its other shortcomings.",

    "quote": "So, Tears of the Kingdom is for me a 10/10 if I just judge it in itself. The problem for me was comparing it to Breath of the Wild, and comparing it quite often. I thought developers just made the game easier, for children, for stupid people? Shrines, temples and bosses were quite poor for me, compared to BotW and other Zelda games. But the new mechanics, abilities and especially the depths made the game still very interesting for me, totally enjoyable. Also this open world, which we already know quite well, is just beautiful and feels like home. Just don't do it a third time, please, Nintendo",

The weapon durability, the koroks, the reused map, and having to practically reunlock every tower and shrine. I actually hated the building function. I hate having to build things in games. I'm mostly just disappointed. With the game, but mostly with myself for not being able to enjoy it.",

    "quote": "Tears of the Kingdom's biggest crime is the same as its predecessor: a huge emphasis on exploration but a saddening lack of meaningful discovery. Make no mistake that this is basically a copy/paste of the same framework as Breath of the Wild, but with one major difference that enhances the experience to another level: Link's new arm abilities. They can manipulate where (and even when) objects are to solve puzzles as well as jumping through ceilings as a brilliant display of vertical traversal. It's a great game, and everyone who loved Breath of the Wild will no doubt love this one as well. But for me personally, I can only play a little at a time before its open world design starts exhausts me more than it should.",

    "quote": "One of the most flawed games ever made, and yet, one of the greatest ever made. Is it Breath of the Wild again? Pretty much. However, do I consider that a flaw? Absolutely not. Tears of the Kingdom is Breath of the Wild but better in almost every way. Breath of the Wild was already one of the greatest games ever made, and if this game is just that but improved and on a bigger scale with a brand new mechanic that completely re-invents the wheel, then what's not to love? The game has its flaws not because it isn't like Ocarina of Time in how it does its dungeons or story structure, instead I think ToTK's approach to dungeons are extremely valid and well-made, but it has its flaws due to some repetition in its world and poor writing in its story. Aside from that, Tears of the Kingdom is the best open world game we've seen to date.",

While it suffers from a lack of story, it more than makes up for it by having over 100+ hours of genuinely good content (not including all the korok seeds) as well as extremely good building mechanics and open world. I would highly recommend it to everyone who even remotely likes open world or adventure games.",

Those who think BOTW is better than TOTK are simply questioning a disruptive and innovative work with the judging framework of traditional games. If the next Zelda game regresses to the level of BOTW in terms of interactive richness, it is likely to succeed, but that will be a pity for the gaming world. Ironically, unlike what many people say, the world design of TOTK and BOTW simply look the same, and every corner is completely new in terms of experience. For people who can only play games on video media, there is probably nothing new about TOTK.",

The opening sequence immediately captured me and left me wanting more. once we gained full control, learning the new mechanics of the game was absolutely delightful. ultrahand especially was the most fun i've ever had learning. The moment the great sky island is finished, the game allows you complete freedom to explore and do whatever you wish. I loved visiting locations that were present in Breath Of the Wild and seeing how the developers changed it. My love for exploration also made traveling the depths one of the most fun parts of the game. there were a ton of mines where i dug up zonaite to upgrade my batteries and every now and then, my exploration would be rewarded with a side quest, or a neat piece of armor that referenced the older zelda games. I smiled from ear to ear upon finding my first piece of the twilight princess set. And the temples for the sages were all so much fun to play through. Especially the wind temple. The atmosphere, music, and dungeon puzzles in that dungeon made me realize that this game was everything I wanted it to be. It's also insane how you can try almost anything with ultrahand and things just work. I don't know how the hell the zelda team pulled off making a game like this work for the switch in just 6 years. the parallels the drew between Zelda and Ganondorf as determined individuals willing to sacrifice everything for their goal, as well as the connection between king Rauru's ideal of what it means to be a king compared to Ganondorf's were executed masterfully. This game was an emotional roller coaster.  Absolutely my favorite game of all time and a must play for anyone who calls themselves a gamer. Not to throw shade at any of the fantastic games that are nominated for GOTY 2023 but after playing them all it feels absolutely impossible that any game other than tears of the kingdom wins. Excellent work Hidemaro Fujibayashi and the rest of your team.",

They successfully disrupted the open-world genre in the prequel, and they made it again in their crafting in this game.\n\nThe reason that I cannot give 10 is similar to Baldur Gate 3. They still have a lot of bugs since its launch (I said a lot since I see it myself in my playthrough and sometimes I cannot get past it), which is understandable since their feature is really big. It also has a minor UX where you cannot control your companion smoothly and disrupt the gameplay. This is the only thing that I see in this game.\n\nOtherwise, If you see the trailer and you want to play it, just buy it. Quality is over the price.",

Breath of the Wild had a sad ending due to the death of the champions but in Tears of the Kingdom despite the death of Mineru's spirit, the post-credits scene conveys joy and peace, defeating Ganondorf, his draconic form and saving to Zelda saving her from the fall and making her Hylian again.\n\nIn conclusion, Tears of the Kingdom surpassed its predecessor in many aspects, making it a totally unique open-world video game.",

The new areas and building on the old map is awesome, but occasionally some areas feel empty. The machine building and weapon crafting is fun as well, but the controls feel a little clunky. There's a tad bit too much when it comes to shrines and collectables, but those quests are mostly skipable if you don't want to do them  The item durability is less of an issue this time around, which was appreciated!

Why is \"send a giant annoying opaque rock monster flying, exploding everything in its path\" the same freaking button as \"pick up this exploding plant\" This only get more annoying with the ever expanding crowd of opaque **** crowding Link doing nothing but block his view and slightly improve the meaningless busy-work that needs to be done. \nAll in all it's a collection of colourful fetch quests in large open spaces by Nintendo.

Shrines, shrines and more shrines for boring rewards, a mostly dark new area full of emptiness and the same main world from the previous game made this a very underwhelming game and I cannot understand the high scores this is getting.",

    "quote": "I don\u2019t know where to start when I heard they were making a sequel of breath of the wild I was not excited at all I hated the very idea of this game because I thought Nintendo was just trying to make a quick money grab because breath of the wild was so successful so I thought this game was going to be mediocre at best. I was not hyped at all for this game. But when it released, I just bought it so I could give it a try and man was I wrong about it, They really put everything into this game. I think this is breath of the wild, truly realized this might sound like a stretch, but it might be the legend of Zelda truly realize with the overwhelmingly huge map, the freedom on how to play the game, the story, and links new abilities This game takes game of the year. Yes the frame rate is bad but and it doesn\u2019t perform like a next gen game should but that\u2019s not what makes a game a game I mean look at Minecraft it\u2019s considered the greatest game of all time yet its graphics are terrible graphics don\u2019t matter and frame rate doesn\u2019t matter either yeah don\u2019t get me wrong though I played spider man 2 and that game has some crispy visuals and I wish totk did run at 60 frames but that should not hold this game back form being game of the year it\u2019s about what you do in the game itself in tears of the Kingdom you can approach any situation in your own unique way for example, you don\u2019t have to draw your sword to kill enemies. You can create a car that has a Canon attached to it and below enemies up from a distance, or attach a flamethrower to your shield to burn your enemies while also protecting your self  there is literally endless ways to go about the game and that\u2019s scratching the surface and I\u2019m not exaggerating. This game is overwhelmingly huge this game will reward your from being curious and taking risks and I can not count how many times I stumbled on a key item or powerful upgrade just because I was curious about a location or something interesting I saw in the distance like I got go important items in that game on accident because I was just messing around in the open world and that\u2019s how an open world games is supposed to be you should be encouraged to be experimental and curious There\u2019s so much to do in this game. The story is also better than breath of the wild in my opinion, because the stories one big mystery and you have to put the pieces together or not it\u2019s completely optional if you what know to know secrets and lore details that game gives your nothing you gotta go out there and get it yourself and that\u2019s a great thing solving puzzle's has so much freedom to it there\u2019s not jut  way to solve a puzzle there are multiple ways to solve one puzzle out of hundreds you\u2019ll face, in most games puzzles are linear. There\u2019s only one way to solve them and that\u2019s not a bad thing, but totk gives the player the freedom to solve a puzzle in your unique way it\u2019s amazing sorry I know that sounds corny and it\u2019s OK if this game doesn\u2019t win game of the year I\u2019m just happy I was able to play it I have 160 hours in and I\u2019m ready to play 160 more. I know this was like an essay so if you made it this far, thank you for reading. I really appreciate it and have a wonderful day and I hope you\u2019re having just as much fun on thismarvelous game as I am.",

It takes everything BOTW was and tops it. \n\nUltrahand is the greatest gaming mechanic ever made. It adds an unprecedented level of creativity and interactivity. There\u2019s nothing more fun or engaging than designing a machine, device, or item to accomplish or reach something. It along with fuse lead the list that adds up to the best set of abilities Zelda has ever had. \n\nIt\u2019s almost inconceivable that arguably the most massive open world game ever made was pulled off on such obsolete hardware with so little compromises. The graphics are somehow immersive and fantastic as a result of Nintendo\u2019s doctorate in cartoon worlds and knowing what makes graphics look good and bad. With that said, I\u2019d still love to see what Nintendo could do with identical hardware to PS5 and Series X. \n\nI spent over 700 hours on this game because I didn\u2019t want it to end and because there\u2019s that much to do in it. \n\nMy only real complaints are that the coordinates should\u2019ve had a movable reticle that shows it\u2019s locations rather than yours, the hero\u2019s quest tracker was too short and should\u2019ve been limitless, that the game could have had a more organized and extensive tracking of true 100% completion and central hub featuring several hundred categories (you can add hundreds of hours to a game by simply creating more to complete), the lack of a meter that shows a weapon\u2019s or shield\u2019s degradation, and the main dungeons should\u2019ve been self contained and lengthier. All that said, as I noted above it\u2019s so good it makes these complaints completely irrelevant. \n\nAt the end of the day, like BOTW it\u2019s as good as gaming gets and further proof Nintendo is untouchable when it comes to game design. I just hate that there\u2019s such an extensive wait in between titles. If only gaming had the same delivery time as TV shows. Imagine a world where we get one Zelda per year or every other year.",

    "quote": "For Tears of the Kingdom, my experience playing through the game has been bad.  I have nothing against TotK using the same map as BotW but with 2 added landscape to explore, the sky and depths.  Exploring the world of TotK seems rewarding at first, but it starts getting old too fast and the only reward is just seeing the sites.  You still have to find hundreds of Korok seeds to expand your weapon, bows, and shields inventories to functional levels.  There are physical dungeons, but they don't hold the charm as the traditional Zelda games achieved.\n\nThe most important factors of any game is the content and how you play in it.  The content is more quantity than quality.  The gameplay feels good if you have plenty of resources to burn through.  Finding great weapons is a bit more difficult in TotK than BotW due to new mechanics from the Zonai technology.  To incentivize using the fusion mechanic, weapons have lower durability than they had in BotW.  As long as you have decent fusion material, you can make \"decent\" weapons, but for me, that fusion material pool is used for too much, and this led to terrible experiences with combat.  If I want a better time dealing with tough encounters, it involved spending hours in the depths farming for bombs and materials.\n\nOverall, the game play is more punishing than Dark Souls type games.  If this is the future of Zelda games, the series is doomed.",

Les gens nous connaissent (et pas que les vieux zoras).\n- Les nombreux pouvoirs permettent de lib\u00e9rer sa cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 de toutes les mani\u00e8res, et les nombreuses solutions aux \u00e9nigmes nous font nous sentir plus malins que le jeu.\n- Un tas de nouveaux plats, de nouvelles tenues, de nouveaux ingr\u00e9dients, de nouvelles fonctionnalit\u00e9s.\n- Une v\u00e9ritable am\u00e9lioration, des d\u00e9tails qui font toute la diff\u00e9rence.\n- La plupart de PNJ sont retravaill\u00e9s. Alors qu'on avait jusque l\u00e0 que trois \u00e2ges (enfant, adulte, personne \u00e2g\u00e9e), un quatri\u00e8me a fait son apparition (adolescent).\n\nPoints n\u00e9gatifs :\n- Un jeu beaucoup trop bazar. On est submerg\u00e9s par des qu\u00eates, des grottes, des puits, des korogus et des monstres.\n- Un total oubli du jeu pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. Toute la technologie arch\u00e9onique a disparu, les ch\u00e2teau d'Hyrule a perdu toute sa saveur. Pas de nouveaux secrets sur les vestiges anciens.\n- La nouvelle technologie magique n'est pas belle. Du vert brillant, de la \"glue\", une batterie...? Et surtout, la technologie magique ne semble pas exister dans l'histoire. Dans Botw, l'histoire \u00e9tait centr\u00e9e sur les gardiens, les sheikas, les cr\u00e9atures divines. L\u00e0, hormis Ganondorf et sa magie, on n'entend jamais les personnages s'en sortir gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la technologie, qui est pourtant le centre du jeu.\n- Pas d'ajouts. Pas de nouveaux peuples, de nouveaux villages, alors que la taille de la map a tripl\u00e9 ! \u00c0 croire que les d\u00e9veloppeurs n'ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 ces nouveaux lieux que pour \"stocker\" du mat\u00e9riel...",

Las habilidades que se presentan podr\u00edan ser, cada una, revolucionarias e incre\u00edbles por s\u00ed solas. Pero no, ac\u00e1 est\u00e1n las 4 juntas. Ya a nivel mec\u00e1nico, este juego es una locura nunca antes vista. La forma en la que se puede manipular todo el entorno, y a su vez usar las diversas habilidades a la ves para hacer lo que te d\u00e9 la gana es una genialidad. Por ejemplo (muy simple), quiero llegar a un lugar alto, entonces agarro una tabla de madera, la alzo, luego la dejo caer y retrocedo el tiempo para infiltrarme. Por m\u00e1s tonto que parezca, esto es una completa locura solo a nivel jugable si no que en programaci\u00f3n. Y para agregar m\u00e1s, se agregaron las islas en el cielo, un subsuelo igual de grande que el mapa original, y una red cientos de cuevas y cientos de pozos en el mapa original. Las f\u00edsicas, a su vez, complementan a las habilidades y el mapa, siendo extremadamente detalladas y retroactivas. Hay tantas cosas para decir sobre este juego, pero intent\u00e9 resumirlo en un p\u00e1rrafo. Simplemente alucinante en todos los aspectos (incluso la m\u00fasica y la direcci\u00f3n de arte por dios!), y uno de los mejores, sino el mejor juego de la historia. 15/10",

Tears of the Kingdom fully embraces its vast world of discovery, mystery, and treasure in ways that seemed impossible before. Its story is even more compelling than its predecessor, your new abilities are game-altering with tons of player-agency, and the world is somehow even more massive and ACTUALLY FILLED WITH THINGS TO DO than it was before. Though its performance leaves a lot to be desired on the docked version of the Switch, that says more about the console than it does the game itself. This is a $70 game that is truly worth its asking price. 10/10!",

Over 152 shrines to explore. 40 hearts to explore and you also have to get 3 bars of stamina to obtain too. And you also need to obtain the master sword which you will get futher on to the game. And the story is very dark and messed up for a Zelda game but you\u2019re ready for the dark and wicked moblins that will want to grab your snacks and your soda. grab them and grab your Switch as you will explore a world of darkness and light as you will see clash against one another inside your tv screen handheld device and enjoy the open world view of hyrule once again.",

The change of Magnesis where you can only move magnetic items to Ultrahand where you can move any free item is great. Each playthrough is unique and there is so much to explore. So much to explore is the only downside. (Also the sages abilities, I MISS YOU REVALI'S GALE). You might be thinking to yourself \"How is too much exploration a downside?\". The reason is that you need an online guide if you want to get 100%. Finding everything on your own would take years. Love this game, 10/10.",

The side quests are more fun as well. Combat has quality of life improvements. The hand abilities are a lot better than BotW's shekiah slate powers. Ultrahand lets me mess around in all kinds of new ways, like driving across large stretches of land, and kill monsters in new ways. Fuse fixed the weapon durability problem. There is one weakness in gameplay: the sage abilities are more gimmicky and less practical (exception being the wind one). The story is an improvement over BotW (mainly due to the tear memories, rather than Link's own quest) but still a bit lacking. The dungeons are decent, with proper elemental themes returning, as well as unique bosses (rather than the boring Blight Ganons in BotW). The finale is pure greatness, and Ganondorf has had his best showing to date.",

In terms of story, it is miles deeper than breath of the wild but dosent shove lore and story down your throat. The new abilities are great, like making Zonai creations or reversing an object back at the enemy. The map is better too with the ability to explore the skies and the depths. However, I think this game will not have the same effect as it's predesscor due to it being maybe \"too similar\" by many.",

However, Tears Of The Kingdom undoubtedly improves on virtually every single aspect of the game, from the core gameplay its self, to minor details within the game, truly defining it as the greatest game OF ALL TIME. \n\nFirstly, Tears of the Kingdom drastically improves upon the dungeons seem within Breath Of The Wild. Although the divine beasts were very good, they felt repetitive, and each one felt like a slight reskin of the other. However, in Tears Of The Kingdom we see a more traditional and unique style to the temples, each fitting their respective areas. The lightning temple, a prime example of how great the temples are, feels much more like a traditional dungeon with rooms throughout the dungeon connecting to each other to form a sensational sequence of puzzles to finish the temple. Furthermore, the journey to the temple itself is sensational, truly setting up the marvel of the temple to come. To further improve upon BOTW, the bosses are drastically improved. The fights are thrilling, entertaining and truly enhance the dungeon further. They are completely unique which makes it feel all the more special. \n\nSecondly, the new abilities introduced truly enhance the gaming experience. Firstly, fuse is essential to fixing the durability problem. Instead of looking for the weapons themselves, fuse allows us to create our own weapons which mean that we are focused upon the materials not the weapons. Ascend allows us to efficiently ascend through ceilings, hills, caves in order to reach another place, almost like revali\u2019s gale. Recall is just out-right amazing. And ultra hand completely revolutionises Tears Of The Kingdom. It allows us to create and tackle the game in what ever way we want, eradication the linear aspect to any puzzle and the game in general. It brings the players imagination to life and truly changes the gameplay experience, making it better than ever. \n\nThirdly, the story of TOTK is more in-depth and meaningful than before. Characters like Zelda are more developed and truly feel essential to the plot. It is all a mystery at first, and engages the reader as we slowly unveil the mystery. And, of course, the introduction of Ganondorf is genius, adding a deceitful, thrilling and powerful antagonist to the plot and giving us the greatest Zelda boss fight ever, and the greatest cinematic ending to a game in history. \n\nFinally, the introduction of the sky Islands and The Depths eradicate the emptiness of breath of the Wild and give us a more jam packed Hyrule. Everywhere you go, there is always a new puzzle, challenge or mystery to the game, perfecting the open world genre. \n\nTears Of The Kingdom doesn\u2019t revolutionise open world gaming, but perfects it and improves upon one the greatest games of all time. It is truly a masterpiece and a must get for any player of any console.",

Unfortunately, the gameplay does get boring and repetitive quickly, especially if you played BOTW. \n\nIf you were questioning wether you needed to play the prequel before this, the answer is NO most definitely not, go straight to TOTK and never look back!\n\nPLAY AND JUDGE",

Tears of the Kingdom's gameplay, despite borrowing plenty from it's predecessor, Breath of the Wild, expands on the amazing foundation with amazing gameplay, a world that is still fun to explore and satisfying puzzles.\n\nHowever, the game's story fails to satisfy is many areas, the memories, unlike Breath of the Wild, are intended to be viewed in a certain order, which is not made clear to the player. This leads to the story being extremely boring and predicable if you view it in any way other than what is intended. The dungeons, while a vast upgrade from that of Breath of the Wild, have unsatisfying pay offs with all 4 being largely the same. This is a shame, as the series is largely known for it's grande and amazing stories. \n\nHowever, the story is still better than many other game, and the new features such as the depths provide many hours of exploration and enjoyment. However, the sky, shown all across advertising, failed to impress, as many are mere copies of each other and the are too disconnected from each other outside of the tutorial area.\n\nHighly recommend, as it is a game where the flaws simply do not outweigh the extraordinary majority of the game",

    "quote": "Hmm, so where to start. It's not bad as a game, if you never played Breath of the Wild. Story would have been better if they just started over, \"like always\". Well, ok. It works. The world? Huge. The map is now in three layers, all about the same size as the map in BotW. Game play? Hmm, weeeeell it's basically the same as BotW but with some small changes (and larger changes that you don't really need). It feels more like a DLC or even a MOD than a new stand-alone game. Would I recommend it? Yes and no. Buy it on sale, but we all know Nintendo doesn't do sale on big games.",

There's too much dialogue, the UI ****, the sky islands are barren, the cutscenes for the dungeons are boring, etc. etc. etc. But all these flaws completely fail to ruin my experience with the game. \n\nThis game gave me an emotion that no other game could have given me. I don't want to do a spoiler review but I can write so much about it. Some of my favorite moments in not only Zelda but gaming history, come from this game and it took me 150 hours to finally decide to fight Ganon. And the ending was... simply fantastic.\n\nMaybe I'm biased or my love for the franchise blinds me to its flaws, but I have not had this much fun with a game since Mario Odyssey nor Celeste.\n\nI don't want to write more. Just know, there are critiques one could give the game, but the highest of highs remain here and I wouldn't trade this experience for anything.\n\nI wondered before what Breath of the Wild was missing when I played that game. It wasn't the weaker abilities; it wasn't the lackluster ending; it wasn't the empty Hyrule. It was one thing: a heart. The charisma and wit of Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, and Skyward Sword were missing in Breath of the Wild. This game has it.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom... has it all. If they just tweaked a few more things and I'd give this a perfect rating",

In many ways it is the game BoTW should have been.\n\nI almost see BoTW as a sort of beta version of ToTK. It is as if the creation of the open world and game mechanics took so much time and resources that the developers did not have time to actually fill the world with content or a story. With ToTK I feel like the mechanics and open world concept was already developed, so now they were able to focus solely on filling the world with content and a richer storyline. \n\nToTK is a true pleasure to play. It is a great game with lots of fun and so much to explore.",

Unfortunately, there is a lot to discuss in it's repetitiveness and over time, it does become boring. Little reward for discovering everything not to mention the grind. Biggest complaints, barren sky and underground, overall game play is easy, cooking and clothing become fairly useless as most of it doesnt do anything that is actually needed to complete the game, and worst of all the very short and low difficulty in the dungeons. I would go for a smaller world that has more content, or missions that give meaningful rewards or add to the \"must do's\" to move forward or access other new content . So the game gets a 7 because it's not fair to score too low because it is well-made, but definitely not a 10 because it is not far off from breath of the wild.",

For me as a Genshin Impact player, this is easily the same as exploring the world again just like when I explored Teyvat back when Genshin first launched, the difference here is I played as Link, the infamous protagonist of Zelda series rather than choosing between two genders like in many other game (Genshin Impact, Honkai Star Rail, Tower of Fantasy and so on). I quickly adapt into the world legend of Zelda (of course with the help of communities posts and walkthroughs) and I find that ToTK have its own unique system that makes it different from BoTW. Though, I'd say that my way of playing is reversed. If anyone wants to start playing Zelda in Nintendo switch, the correct order is BoTW then ToTK since they just differs in timeline.",

As for the soundtrack, it is beter (in my opinion) and I am glad the tamples feel like dounges, I didn't hate the divine beast but let's be real who wants them back. And here comes the critisizam, the abilities are trash, they are not terable but compeare to botw they are bad, I don't even use them like at all, BUT it's not that bad, they can be useful sometimes. But man the amount of stuf you can do is INSANE, you want to go thru walls, you can, you want to build almost anything your stupid brain thinks of, you can, you want to fuse wepont with anything you find, you can.",

You find a shrine, it is a puzzle, to get korok seeds solve a puzzle, even finding out what to do for quests are puzzles. Even boss fights are puzzle and I hated that. Dude let me fight these mfs normally but no first you have to shoot its eye and then you can deal the damage, no you have beat 3 heads first and then you can deal the damage, otherwise they are just spamming their **** and they dont give you proper time to deal some damage. The most fair fights are lynels and they are fun and challenging. The others are just feel like you are solving puzzle over and over again and I am sick of it. Give me proper boss fights. Another problem is armor. I upgraded my armor to the highest and I didn't see the difference and it's same with weapons. At the beginning of the game I was wearing weapons with 10-15 attack and after some time it increased to 50 but I still didn't feel the difference. It didn't make me feel like, oh this weapon is strong... So this kind of things killed the mood for me... And to be honest, I feel bored 80% of the time. Because the game mechanics that are supposed to entertain you are just puzzles. Even the action itself is a puzzle, but it is supposed to be dynamic.\nAnyway that's the all the complains that I have. But I understand why it has such a high score and people think it is a masterpiece and all but it is not like that for me, still a great game though.",

The ultrahand ability is super impressive, the ascend ability was a genius addition, and the fuse mechanic gives meaning to the weapon durability. Dungeons are improved but still not at the level of classic Zelda titles. Though I loved Totk it disappointed me in a few ways. I believe using the same map was a mistake. The core formula has already become stale as it is basically identical to BotW. Totk does basically nothing to address the many of the problems discovered in BotW. While I\u2019m very impressed by what Totk has accomplished, I know that the future of Zelda must recognize its loyal \u201cclassic\u201d fans in order to maintain its status as one of the greatest gaming series. The Zelda team should analyze why some Zelda fans are worried for the franchise\u2019s future.",

This includes a better story and more interesting side quests. Second, the action possiblity are so much more satisfying. Ultrahand, fuse, and ascend open up so many possibilities and allow for creativity. This makes moving around the map and solving puzzles much more satisfying. Third, it maintains the feeling of tranquility and beauty.\nI am giving this a 9 for now, but only because I want to play some more before I proclaim it as a 10/10 masterpiece.

All the Chests you get, have useless stuff in them, just another batch of bow/sword/shield... put them to the 50 other ones in your inventory. Having to walk to my next destination scared me more than Ganondorf and his lackeys and you know whats worse? now you get the same empty useless world in the sky and in the depths.\nThe Whole game felt like a chore to play. Just finished it at around 65h, not gonna continue or play the sidequests.\n\nPro:\n- Crafting variety is huge, some ppl will love to build machines etc. (not me)\n- gameplay is nice, swordplay and bow etc. is great\n-love the coloring of the game\n- interesting characters including both mcs and villain\n\ncon:\n- cant call your horse from more than 20 meters. not gonna buy any dlc for that tbh, nintendo has to learn to build in quality of life features (they are probably scared that it would cut the playtime short if you were on horseback all the time)\n- weapon durability\n- weapons overall,  mastersword is probably the biggest joke ever.\nthe only good weapons in the game are either limited or have big debuffs... is that supposed to be fun?\n- tedious sidequests, like unlocking the fairies for equipment enchancment (they should beat the guy up who came up with that idea)\n- equipment enchancement costs too much, 4x upgradeable, costs 10, 50, 200, 500, so760 just for 1 piece + rare materials (so selling them is not an option, they should also beat up that guy, but is probably the same dude), 2280 rupees for just 1 set of clothing to max and there are above 15 or so sets.\n- farming money/rupees is almost impossible and goes too slow, quests reward you max with 300, the gems are way to scarce and are needed for upgrading or weapon buff\n- shrines are harder to find compared to botw, wasnt fun to look for them, not gonna open a gameguide for that\n- depths are just pure suffering. cant see more than 5 meters ahead, gloom everywhere and mobs that either put gloom on you or oneshot you... the whole idea is nice but the realization is so bad.\n- Dragontear quests should be fixed, so that you get the videos in order, mine were all over the place. so i was confused till i stopped playing and watched the whole video in order on youtube. that way i could spoil myself and also have atleast some clue what was going on\n- damage scaling is very bad. i was hitting like a truck with my 70+ dmg weapon but still couldnt scratch the silver class monsters, burned many good weapons on some random mobs\n- the game is trying too hard to be mysterious .. i dont want to explore everything, give me a clear line, show me where i have to go, where i can find the caves etc., the world is too big and everything looks similar so i dont wanna go to most of those places and explore them\n\ni enjoyed the game but it had moments where i absolutely hated it.\ni am glad that i played it, but i will def not preorder the next zelda title thankts to this game",

The previous game had a complaint of Ganon being too easy and that is not the case in TOTK. Overall the building mechanic is great and a welcome addition to the world. The only downside in my opinion is the game overstays its welcome slightly. You have to do something major before fighting Ganon that drags out the story another 5 hours. Other than that the game is a must play imo.",

    "quote": "It irons out almost all of BotW's weaknesses.GOOD:- Gigantic open world with lots of secrets and unique caves.- A comprehensible story with an epic climax, albeit very predictable.- GANONDORF IS BACK! The final battle is epic, but simple. This is probably the way to pick up casuals and veterans alike.- The skills! Weaponfuse as well as building vehicles is great! Crafting weapons in particular is great fun. There aren't too many special fusions in the end, but it solves the problem that BotW still had. Battles are motivating. You are well rewarded and make noticeable progress without a level system.AVERAGE:- Timeback Skill - is very helpful, but also necessary in places to rewind the far-flying parts that didn't land where you physically expected them to.- Bosses - they're still not as good as they were in previous Zelda instalments, but better than the Ganon fights in ****:- Enemy Variation. BotW already had few enemies, but TotK simply has too few enemies for a game in 2023. Only a handful of new ones have been added. I would have liked more creative enemies here, especially because of Weaponfuse.- Dungeons. Someone says that the great dungeons of the good Zelda days have returned. I can't confirm that. The 4 story dungeons are even worse than the Divine Beasts. The fire and water temples in particular are just areas stuck together with no depth. The worst dungeons Zelda has ever had.- Sky Islands: Of all things, the main focus of the marketing is the weakest area in the entire game. It's more a question of how you get up there. Once you're up there, one of three copy-paste patterns awaits the player. Boring. On top of that, there is a pathetic variety of enemies up here. There are really only the small robots and maybe the occasional flying enemy.- Underground. Provides strong kicks for the first 3 hours. Then it becomes just as trivially boring as the Sky **** GO:- There's nothing worse for an open world than copying the world from the previous instalment and barely reworking it. There are caves, which are the best innovation on the surface. Everything else in the familiar open world is a bitter disappointment. Exploration is no fun. Worse still: where there was nothing in BotW, there is often nothing to be found in TotK either. So the open world degenerates even more into an Ubisoft junk world.TLDR: A masterpiece that fails due to its open world formula and doesn't make the most of its cool game design ideas.",

TotK is everything BotW was not, it's unrewarding, grindy, immersion-breaking, poorly written, trend-chasing, un-interactive, and, frankly, stupid. \n\nThe core gameplay loop of exploration doesn't work without a world designed for that exploration, that the player has not experienced and does not fully understand. That was BotW innovation. TotK fails to understand this on a fundamental level to such a degree that we might even start to think BotW was a fluke. \n\nBeyond that, TotK's new mechanics actually negatively impact BotW's other major innovation: world interaction. Because, you no longer have to think about the terrain when you can just Ascend past it all or build a flying machine to bypass it all. It's kind of amazing how little they considered BotW when making this game.\n\nThen, there's the story, which tries to pretend all other Zelda games never existed. BotW included, despite being a sequel. Never seen anything like it before, but it's awful.",

What happened to the 4 races of hyrule? What changed? As you explore the surface of Hyrule, you never run out of questions to ask. The depths, and the sky islands, nurture this constant sense of curiosity, drawing your eyes to them, perhaps not acting as second and third maps, but rather like additional locations on the original map, fueling your imagination and curiosity. While the rewards at the end of the trail these questions lead you on may not necessarily be the best or most useful, what is fulfilling is the journey, the act of travelling, the anticipation, and the discovery along the way itself. Along with the constant discovery and exploration, there were some of the highest highlights along the way. This game is the king of setting the mood. The sounds, the atmosphere, and the visuals of the Lightning Temple, Wind Temple and Fire Temple set the mood in the best way possible, getting you ready to take on the puzzles, enemies and bosses.\n\nThis game nails the *feeling* of exploration, wonder, and curiosity, enhanced by the gorgeous artstyle and mood setting. This, is what sets this game apart, and this is what makes this game a 10/10 for me, despite all its other shortcomings.",

Tears of the Kingdom is Breath of the Wild but better in almost every way. Breath of the Wild was already one of the greatest games ever made, and if this game is just that but improved and on a bigger scale with a brand new mechanic that completely re-invents the wheel, then what's not to love? The game has its flaws not because it isn't like Ocarina of Time in how it does its dungeons or story structure, instead I think ToTK's approach to dungeons are extremely valid and well-made, but it has its flaws due to some repetition in its world and poor writing in its story. Aside from that, Tears of the Kingdom is the best open world game we've seen to date.",

Direi che \u00e8 una bella sensazione.\nPer tutti quelli che criticano il fatto che sia troppo simile al predecessore io rispondo che secondo me va benissimo cos\u00ec e poi dobbiamo anche contare il fatto che TOTK si svolge subito dopo gli avvenimenti di BOTW quindi non \u00e8 che ci fosse tanto da poter cambiare. Quindi per concludere dico che TOTK \u00e8 un bellissimo gioco anche se non eguaglia BOTW.",

Those who think BOTW is better than TOTK are simply questioning a disruptive and innovative work with the judging framework of traditional games. If the next Zelda game regresses to the level of BOTW in terms of interactive richness, it is likely to succeed, but that will be a pity for the gaming world. Ironically, unlike what many people say, the world design of TOTK and BOTW simply look the same, and every corner is completely new in terms of experience. For people who can only play games on video media, there is probably nothing new about TOTK.",

    "quote": "This was the single greatest gaming experience I have ever had. The opening sequence immediately captured me and left me wanting more. once we gained full control, learning the new mechanics of the game was absolutely delightful. ultrahand especially was the most fun i've ever had learning. The moment the great sky island is finished, the game allows you complete freedom to explore and do whatever you wish. I loved visiting locations that were present in Breath Of the Wild and seeing how the developers changed it. My love for exploration also made traveling the depths one of the most fun parts of the game. there were a ton of mines where i dug up zonaite to upgrade my batteries and every now and then, my exploration would be rewarded with a side quest, or a neat piece of armor that referenced the older zelda games. I smiled from ear to ear upon finding my first piece of the twilight princess set. And the temples for the sages were all so much fun to play through. Especially the wind temple. The atmosphere, music, and dungeon puzzles in that dungeon made me realize that this game was everything I wanted it to be. It's also insane how you can try almost anything with ultrahand and things just work. I don't know how the hell the zelda team pulled off making a game like this work for the switch in just 6 years. the parallels the drew between Zelda and Ganondorf as determined individuals willing to sacrifice everything for their goal, as well as the connection between king Rauru's ideal of what it means to be a king compared to Ganondorf's were executed masterfully. This game was an emotional roller coaster.  Absolutely my favorite game of all time and a must play for anyone who calls themselves a gamer. Not to throw shade at any of the fantastic games that are nominated for GOTY 2023 but after playing them all it feels absolutely impossible that any game other than tears of the kingdom wins. Excellent work Hidemaro Fujibayashi and the rest of your team.",

Exploration, Characters, Worldbuilding, Crafting, Creativity. They successfully disrupted the open-world genre in the prequel, and they made it again in their crafting in this game.\n\nThe reason that I cannot give 10 is similar to Baldur Gate 3. They still have a lot of bugs since its launch (I said a lot since I see it myself in my playthrough and sometimes I cannot get past it), which is understandable since their feature is really big. It also has a minor UX where you cannot control your companion smoothly and disrupt the gameplay. This is the only thing that I see in this game.\n\nOtherwise, If you see the trailer and you want to play it, just buy it. Quality is over the price.",

Breath of the Wild had a sad ending due to the death of the champions but in Tears of the Kingdom despite the death of Mineru's spirit, the post-credits scene conveys joy and peace, defeating Ganondorf, his draconic form and saving to Zelda saving her from the fall and making her Hylian again.\n\nIn conclusion, Tears of the Kingdom surpassed its predecessor in many aspects, making it a totally unique open-world video game.",

The new areas and building on the old map is awesome, but occasionally some areas feel empty. The machine building and weapon crafting is fun as well, but the controls feel a little clunky. There's a tad bit too much when it comes to shrines and collectables, but those quests are mostly skipable if you don't want to do them  The item durability is less of an issue this time around, which was appreciated!

The uninspired narrative, lackluster visuals, poorly implemented open-world mechanics, and technical shortcomings collectively make Tears of the Kingdom the worst entry in the Zelda franchise, tarnishing the legacy of a series that has long been celebrated for its innovation, charm, and timeless appeal.",

I'm a long time Zelda fan and TOTK is now my favorite game of all times.\n\nIf you're a Zelda fan, you must play this game, if you've never played Zelda before, give this title a try, it can be the first Zelda experience you need, otherwise, try Skyward Sword and other 3D Zelda games first. \n\nTotk is definately a GOTY for me, or should I say GOTD/GOTG - game of the decade, game of the generation. \n\nHope you'll get the same incredible adventure I had with this game.",

Shrines, shrines and more shrines for boring rewards, a mostly dark new area full of emptiness and the same main world from the previous game made this a very underwhelming game and I cannot understand the high scores this is getting.",

    "quote": "I don\u2019t know where to start when I heard they were making a sequel of breath of the wild I was not excited at all I hated the very idea of this game because I thought Nintendo was just trying to make a quick money grab because breath of the wild was so successful so I thought this game was going to be mediocre at best. I was not hyped at all for this game. But when it released, I just bought it so I could give it a try and man was I wrong about it, They really put everything into this game. I think this is breath of the wild, truly realized this might sound like a stretch, but it might be the legend of Zelda truly realize with the overwhelmingly huge map, the freedom on how to play the game, the story, and links new abilities This game takes game of the year. Yes the frame rate is bad but and it doesn\u2019t perform like a next gen game should but that\u2019s not what makes a game a game I mean look at Minecraft it\u2019s considered the greatest game of all time yet its graphics are terrible graphics don\u2019t matter and frame rate doesn\u2019t matter either yeah don\u2019t get me wrong though I played spider man 2 and that game has some crispy visuals and I wish totk did run at 60 frames but that should not hold this game back form being game of the year it\u2019s about what you do in the game itself in tears of the Kingdom you can approach any situation in your own unique way for example, you don\u2019t have to draw your sword to kill enemies. You can create a car that has a Canon attached to it and below enemies up from a distance, or attach a flamethrower to your shield to burn your enemies while also protecting your self  there is literally endless ways to go about the game and that\u2019s scratching the surface and I\u2019m not exaggerating. This game is overwhelmingly huge this game will reward your from being curious and taking risks and I can not count how many times I stumbled on a key item or powerful upgrade just because I was curious about a location or something interesting I saw in the distance like I got go important items in that game on accident because I was just messing around in the open world and that\u2019s how an open world games is supposed to be you should be encouraged to be experimental and curious There\u2019s so much to do in this game. The story is also better than breath of the wild in my opinion, because the stories one big mystery and you have to put the pieces together or not it\u2019s completely optional if you what know to know secrets and lore details that game gives your nothing you gotta go out there and get it yourself and that\u2019s a great thing solving puzzle's has so much freedom to it there\u2019s not jut  way to solve a puzzle there are multiple ways to solve one puzzle out of hundreds you\u2019ll face, in most games puzzles are linear. There\u2019s only one way to solve them and that\u2019s not a bad thing, but totk gives the player the freedom to solve a puzzle in your unique way it\u2019s amazing sorry I know that sounds corny and it\u2019s OK if this game doesn\u2019t win game of the year I\u2019m just happy I was able to play it I have 160 hours in and I\u2019m ready to play 160 more. I know this was like an essay so if you made it this far, thank you for reading. I really appreciate it and have a wonderful day and I hope you\u2019re having just as much fun on thismarvelous game as I am.",

It takes everything BOTW was and tops it. \n\nUltrahand is the greatest gaming mechanic ever made. It adds an unprecedented level of creativity and interactivity. There\u2019s nothing more fun or engaging than designing a machine, device, or item to accomplish or reach something. It along with fuse lead the list that adds up to the best set of abilities Zelda has ever had. \n\nIt\u2019s almost inconceivable that arguably the most massive open world game ever made was pulled off on such obsolete hardware with so little compromises. The graphics are somehow immersive and fantastic as a result of Nintendo\u2019s doctorate in cartoon worlds and knowing what makes graphics look good and bad. With that said, I\u2019d still love to see what Nintendo could do with identical hardware to PS5 and Series X. \n\nI spent over 700 hours on this game because I didn\u2019t want it to end and because there\u2019s that much to do in it. \n\nMy only real complaints are that the coordinates should\u2019ve had a movable reticle that shows it\u2019s locations rather than yours, the hero\u2019s quest tracker was too short and should\u2019ve been limitless, that the game could have had a more organized and extensive tracking of true 100% completion and central hub featuring several hundred categories (you can add hundreds of hours to a game by simply creating more to complete), the lack of a meter that shows a weapon\u2019s or shield\u2019s degradation, and the main dungeons should\u2019ve been self contained and lengthier. All that said, as I noted above it\u2019s so good it makes these complaints completely irrelevant. \n\nAt the end of the day, like BOTW it\u2019s as good as gaming gets and further proof Nintendo is untouchable when it comes to game design. I just hate that there\u2019s such an extensive wait in between titles. If only gaming had the same delivery time as TV shows. Imagine a world where we get one Zelda per year or every other year.",

Flowers of every hue bloom in harmonious symphony, reflecting the vibrancy of life that pulses through this fantastical kingdom. The air is infused with a fragrance so sweet, it is said to be the essence of the tears shed by the princess in the ancient **** the heart of the Kingdom of Tears stands a palace of mesmerizing beauty, its spires reaching toward the heavens. It is here that the tragic love story unfolds\u2014a narrative of star-crossed lovers whose passion transcends the boundaries of time.

The tears, now illuminated by the silvery light of the moon, create a spectacle that leaves visitors breathless. It is a realm where fantasy and reality converge, and the echoes of the princess's lament become a hauntingly beautiful melody that lingers in the air.Travelers who venture into the Kingdom of Tears find themselves bewitched by its spell, not merely by its visual splendors but by the palpable sense of magic that permeates every corner. It is a place where dreams are born, and where the very air seems to shimmer with the promise of **** the grand tapestry of Seldara's legends, the Kingdom of Tears emerges as a jewel\u2014a beacon of beauty, resilience, and the enduring power of love. It invites all who dare to dream to step into its embrace and be transported to a realm where tears are not just symbols of sorrow but also tokens of a love that defies the boundaries of time and reality.",

    "quote": "For Tears of the Kingdom, my experience playing through the game has been bad.  I have nothing against TotK using the same map as BotW but with 2 added landscape to explore, the sky and depths.  Exploring the world of TotK seems rewarding at first, but it starts getting old too fast and the only reward is just seeing the sites.  You still have to find hundreds of Korok seeds to expand your weapon, bows, and shields inventories to functional levels.  There are physical dungeons, but they don't hold the charm as the traditional Zelda games achieved.\n\nThe most important factors of any game is the content and how you play in it.  The content is more quantity than quality.  The gameplay feels good if you have plenty of resources to burn through.  Finding great weapons is a bit more difficult in TotK than BotW due to new mechanics from the Zonai technology.  To incentivize using the fusion mechanic, weapons have lower durability than they had in BotW.  As long as you have decent fusion material, you can make \"decent\" weapons, but for me, that fusion material pool is used for too much, and this led to terrible experiences with combat.  If I want a better time dealing with tough encounters, it involved spending hours in the depths farming for bombs and materials.\n\nOverall, the game play is more punishing than Dark Souls type games.  If this is the future of Zelda games, the series is doomed.",

    "quote": "Virtually flawless. The Legend of Zelda benefits from one fact that many titles as of late have been neglecting. It is a video game FIRST, and a dang good one at that. Tears of the Kingdom fully embraces its vast world of discovery, mystery, and treasure in ways that seemed impossible before. Its story is even more compelling than its predecessor, your new abilities are game-altering with tons of player-agency, and the world is somehow even more massive and ACTUALLY FILLED WITH THINGS TO DO than it was before. Though its performance leaves a lot to be desired on the docked version of the Switch, that says more about the console than it does the game itself. This is a $70 game that is truly worth its asking price. 10/10!",

I cannot believe what these guys at Nintendo did on this weak handheld console, only one word can describe it: revolutionary.",

Over 152 shrines to explore. 40 hearts to explore and you also have to get 3 bars of stamina to obtain too. And you also need to obtain the master sword which you will get futher on to the game. And the story is very dark and messed up for a Zelda game but you\u2019re ready for the dark and wicked moblins that will want to grab your snacks and your soda. grab them and grab your Switch as you will explore a world of darkness and light as you will see clash against one another inside your tv screen handheld device and enjoy the open world view of hyrule once again.",

The change of Magnesis where you can only move magnetic items to Ultrahand where you can move any free item is great. Each playthrough is unique and there is so much to explore. So much to explore is the only downside. (Also the sages abilities, I MISS YOU REVALI'S GALE). You might be thinking to yourself \"How is too much exploration a downside?\". The reason is that you need an online guide if you want to get 100%. Finding everything on your own would take years. Love this game, 10/10.",

The side quests are more fun as well. Combat has quality of life improvements. The hand abilities are a lot better than BotW's shekiah slate powers. Ultrahand lets me mess around in all kinds of new ways, like driving across large stretches of land, and kill monsters in new ways. Fuse fixed the weapon durability problem. There is one weakness in gameplay: the sage abilities are more gimmicky and less practical (exception being the wind one). The story is an improvement over BotW (mainly due to the tear memories, rather than Link's own quest) but still a bit lacking. The dungeons are decent, with proper elemental themes returning, as well as unique bosses (rather than the boring Blight Ganons in BotW). The finale is pure greatness, and Ganondorf has had his best showing to date.",

In terms of story, it is miles deeper than breath of the wild but dosent shove lore and story down your throat. The new abilities are great, like making Zonai creations or reversing an object back at the enemy. The map is better too with the ability to explore the skies and the depths. However, I think this game will not have the same effect as it's predesscor due to it being maybe \"too similar\" by many.",

However, Tears Of The Kingdom undoubtedly improves on virtually every single aspect of the game, from the core gameplay its self, to minor details within the game, truly defining it as the greatest game OF ALL TIME. \n\nFirstly, Tears of the Kingdom drastically improves upon the dungeons seem within Breath Of The Wild. Although the divine beasts were very good, they felt repetitive, and each one felt like a slight reskin of the other. However, in Tears Of The Kingdom we see a more traditional and unique style to the temples, each fitting their respective areas. The lightning temple, a prime example of how great the temples are, feels much more like a traditional dungeon with rooms throughout the dungeon connecting to each other to form a sensational sequence of puzzles to finish the temple. Furthermore, the journey to the temple itself is sensational, truly setting up the marvel of the temple to come. To further improve upon BOTW, the bosses are drastically improved. The fights are thrilling, entertaining and truly enhance the dungeon further. They are completely unique which makes it feel all the more special. \n\nSecondly, the new abilities introduced truly enhance the gaming experience. Firstly, fuse is essential to fixing the durability problem. Instead of looking for the weapons themselves, fuse allows us to create our own weapons which mean that we are focused upon the materials not the weapons. Ascend allows us to efficiently ascend through ceilings, hills, caves in order to reach another place, almost like revali\u2019s gale. Recall is just out-right amazing. And ultra hand completely revolutionises Tears Of The Kingdom. It allows us to create and tackle the game in what ever way we want, eradication the linear aspect to any puzzle and the game in general. It brings the players imagination to life and truly changes the gameplay experience, making it better than ever. \n\nThirdly, the story of TOTK is more in-depth and meaningful than before. Characters like Zelda are more developed and truly feel essential to the plot. It is all a mystery at first, and engages the reader as we slowly unveil the mystery. And, of course, the introduction of Ganondorf is genius, adding a deceitful, thrilling and powerful antagonist to the plot and giving us the greatest Zelda boss fight ever, and the greatest cinematic ending to a game in history. \n\nFinally, the introduction of the sky Islands and The Depths eradicate the emptiness of breath of the Wild and give us a more jam packed Hyrule. Everywhere you go, there is always a new puzzle, challenge or mystery to the game, perfecting the open world genre. \n\nTears Of The Kingdom doesn\u2019t revolutionise open world gaming, but perfects it and improves upon one the greatest games of all time. It is truly a masterpiece and a must get for any player of any console.",

Unfortunately, the gameplay does get boring and repetitive quickly, especially if you played BOTW. \n\nIf you were questioning wether you needed to play the prequel before this, the answer is NO most definitely not, go straight to TOTK and never look back!\n\nPLAY AND JUDGE",

Tears of the Kingdom's gameplay, despite borrowing plenty from it's predecessor, Breath of the Wild, expands on the amazing foundation with amazing gameplay, a world that is still fun to explore and satisfying puzzles.\n\nHowever, the game's story fails to satisfy is many areas, the memories, unlike Breath of the Wild, are intended to be viewed in a certain order, which is not made clear to the player. This leads to the story being extremely boring and predicable if you view it in any way other than what is intended. The dungeons, while a vast upgrade from that of Breath of the Wild, have unsatisfying pay offs with all 4 being largely the same. This is a shame, as the series is largely known for it's grande and amazing stories. \n\nHowever, the story is still better than many other game, and the new features such as the depths provide many hours of exploration and enjoyment. However, the sky, shown all across advertising, failed to impress, as many are mere copies of each other and the are too disconnected from each other outside of the tutorial area.\n\nHighly recommend, as it is a game where the flaws simply do not outweigh the extraordinary majority of the game",

    "quote": "Hmm, so where to start. It's not bad as a game, if you never played Breath of the Wild. Story would have been better if they just started over, \"like always\". Well, ok. It works. The world? Huge. The map is now in three layers, all about the same size as the map in BotW. Game play? Hmm, weeeeell it's basically the same as BotW but with some small changes (and larger changes that you don't really need). It feels more like a DLC or even a MOD than a new stand-alone game. Would I recommend it? Yes and no. Buy it on sale, but we all know Nintendo doesn't do sale on big games.",

There's too much dialogue, the UI ****, the sky islands are barren, the cutscenes for the dungeons are boring, etc. etc. etc. But all these flaws completely fail to ruin my experience with the game. \n\nThis game gave me an emotion that no other game could have given me. I don't want to do a spoiler review but I can write so much about it. Some of my favorite moments in not only Zelda but gaming history, come from this game and it took me 150 hours to finally decide to fight Ganon. And the ending was... simply fantastic.\n\nMaybe I'm biased or my love for the franchise blinds me to its flaws, but I have not had this much fun with a game since Mario Odyssey nor Celeste.\n\nI don't want to write more. Just know, there are critiques one could give the game, but the highest of highs remain here and I wouldn't trade this experience for anything.\n\nI wondered before what Breath of the Wild was missing when I played that game. It wasn't the weaker abilities; it wasn't the lackluster ending; it wasn't the empty Hyrule. It was one thing: a heart. The charisma and wit of Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, and Skyward Sword were missing in Breath of the Wild. This game has it.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom... has it all. If they just tweaked a few more things and I'd give this a perfect rating",

In many ways it is the game BoTW should have been.\n\nI almost see BoTW as a sort of beta version of ToTK. It is as if the creation of the open world and game mechanics took so much time and resources that the developers did not have time to actually fill the world with content or a story. With ToTK I feel like the mechanics and open world concept was already developed, so now they were able to focus solely on filling the world with content and a richer storyline. \n\nToTK is a true pleasure to play. It is a great game with lots of fun and so much to explore.",

Unfortunately, there is a lot to discuss in it's repetitiveness and over time, it does become boring. Little reward for discovering everything not to mention the grind. Biggest complaints, barren sky and underground, overall game play is easy, cooking and clothing become fairly useless as most of it doesnt do anything that is actually needed to complete the game, and worst of all the very short and low difficulty in the dungeons. I would go for a smaller world that has more content, or missions that give meaningful rewards or add to the \"must do's\" to move forward or access other new content . So the game gets a 7 because it's not fair to score too low because it is well-made, but definitely not a 10 because it is not far off from breath of the wild.",

For me as a Genshin Impact player, this is easily the same as exploring the world again just like when I explored Teyvat back when Genshin first launched, the difference here is I played as Link, the infamous protagonist of Zelda series rather than choosing between two genders like in many other game (Genshin Impact, Honkai Star Rail, Tower of Fantasy and so on). I quickly adapt into the world legend of Zelda (of course with the help of communities posts and walkthroughs) and I find that ToTK have its own unique system that makes it different from BoTW. Though, I'd say that my way of playing is reversed. If anyone wants to start playing Zelda in Nintendo switch, the correct order is BoTW then ToTK since they just differs in timeline.",

As for the soundtrack, it is beter (in my opinion) and I am glad the tamples feel like dounges, I didn't hate the divine beast but let's be real who wants them back. And here comes the critisizam, the abilities are trash, they are not terable but compeare to botw they are bad, I don't even use them like at all, BUT it's not that bad, they can be useful sometimes. But man the amount of stuf you can do is INSANE, you want to go thru walls, you can, you want to build almost anything your stupid brain thinks of, you can, you want to fuse wepont with anything you find, you can.",

You find a shrine, it is a puzzle, to get korok seeds solve a puzzle, even finding out what to do for quests are puzzles. Even boss fights are puzzle and I hated that. Dude let me fight these mfs normally but no first you have to shoot its eye and then you can deal the damage, no you have beat 3 heads first and then you can deal the damage, otherwise they are just spamming their **** and they dont give you proper time to deal some damage. The most fair fights are lynels and they are fun and challenging. The others are just feel like you are solving puzzle over and over again and I am sick of it. Give me proper boss fights. Another problem is armor. I upgraded my armor to the highest and I didn't see the difference and it's same with weapons. At the beginning of the game I was wearing weapons with 10-15 attack and after some time it increased to 50 but I still didn't feel the difference. It didn't make me feel like, oh this weapon is strong... So this kind of things killed the mood for me... And to be honest, I feel bored 80% of the time. Because the game mechanics that are supposed to entertain you are just puzzles. Even the action itself is a puzzle, but it is supposed to be dynamic.\nAnyway that's the all the complains that I have. But I understand why it has such a high score and people think it is a masterpiece and all but it is not like that for me, still a great game though.",

The ultrahand ability is super impressive, the ascend ability was a genius addition, and the fuse mechanic gives meaning to the weapon durability. Dungeons are improved but still not at the level of classic Zelda titles. Though I loved Totk it disappointed me in a few ways. I believe using the same map was a mistake. The core formula has already become stale as it is basically identical to BotW. Totk does basically nothing to address the many of the problems discovered in BotW. While I\u2019m very impressed by what Totk has accomplished, I know that the future of Zelda must recognize its loyal \u201cclassic\u201d fans in order to maintain its status as one of the greatest gaming series. The Zelda team should analyze why some Zelda fans are worried for the franchise\u2019s future.",

This includes a better story and more interesting side quests. Second, the action possiblity are so much more satisfying. Ultrahand, fuse, and ascend open up so many possibilities and allow for creativity. This makes moving around the map and solving puzzles much more satisfying. Third, it maintains the feeling of tranquility and beauty.\nI am giving this a 9 for now, but only because I want to play some more before I proclaim it as a 10/10 masterpiece.

All the Chests you get, have useless stuff in them, just another batch of bow/sword/shield... put them to the 50 other ones in your inventory. Having to walk to my next destination scared me more than Ganondorf and his lackeys and you know whats worse? now you get the same empty useless world in the sky and in the depths.\nThe Whole game felt like a chore to play. Just finished it at around 65h, not gonna continue or play the sidequests.\n\nPro:\n- Crafting variety is huge, some ppl will love to build machines etc. (not me)\n- gameplay is nice, swordplay and bow etc. is great\n-love the coloring of the game\n- interesting characters including both mcs and villain\n\ncon:\n- cant call your horse from more than 20 meters. not gonna buy any dlc for that tbh, nintendo has to learn to build in quality of life features (they are probably scared that it would cut the playtime short if you were on horseback all the time)\n- weapon durability\n- weapons overall,  mastersword is probably the biggest joke ever.\nthe only good weapons in the game are either limited or have big debuffs... is that supposed to be fun?\n- tedious sidequests, like unlocking the fairies for equipment enchancment (they should beat the guy up who came up with that idea)\n- equipment enchancement costs too much, 4x upgradeable, costs 10, 50, 200, 500, so760 just for 1 piece + rare materials (so selling them is not an option, they should also beat up that guy, but is probably the same dude), 2280 rupees for just 1 set of clothing to max and there are above 15 or so sets.\n- farming money/rupees is almost impossible and goes too slow, quests reward you max with 300, the gems are way to scarce and are needed for upgrading or weapon buff\n- shrines are harder to find compared to botw, wasnt fun to look for them, not gonna open a gameguide for that\n- depths are just pure suffering. cant see more than 5 meters ahead, gloom everywhere and mobs that either put gloom on you or oneshot you... the whole idea is nice but the realization is so bad.\n- Dragontear quests should be fixed, so that you get the videos in order, mine were all over the place. so i was confused till i stopped playing and watched the whole video in order on youtube. that way i could spoil myself and also have atleast some clue what was going on\n- damage scaling is very bad. i was hitting like a truck with my 70+ dmg weapon but still couldnt scratch the silver class monsters, burned many good weapons on some random mobs\n- the game is trying too hard to be mysterious .. i dont want to explore everything, give me a clear line, show me where i have to go, where i can find the caves etc., the world is too big and everything looks similar so i dont wanna go to most of those places and explore them\n\ni enjoyed the game but it had moments where i absolutely hated it.\ni am glad that i played it, but i will def not preorder the next zelda title thankts to this game",

The previous game had a complaint of Ganon being too easy and that is not the case in TOTK. Overall the building mechanic is great and a welcome addition to the world. The only downside in my opinion is the game overstays its welcome slightly. You have to do something major before fighting Ganon that drags out the story another 5 hours. Other than that the game is a must play imo.",

    "quote": "It irons out almost all of BotW's weaknesses.GOOD:- Gigantic open world with lots of secrets and unique caves.- A comprehensible story with an epic climax, albeit very predictable.- GANONDORF IS BACK! The final battle is epic, but simple. This is probably the way to pick up casuals and veterans alike.- The skills! Weaponfuse as well as building vehicles is great! Crafting weapons in particular is great fun. There aren't too many special fusions in the end, but it solves the problem that BotW still had. Battles are motivating. You are well rewarded and make noticeable progress without a level system.AVERAGE:- Timeback Skill - is very helpful, but also necessary in places to rewind the far-flying parts that didn't land where you physically expected them to.- Bosses - they're still not as good as they were in previous Zelda instalments, but better than the Ganon fights in ****:- Enemy Variation. BotW already had few enemies, but TotK simply has too few enemies for a game in 2023. Only a handful of new ones have been added. I would have liked more creative enemies here, especially because of Weaponfuse.- Dungeons. Someone says that the great dungeons of the good Zelda days have returned. I can't confirm that. The 4 story dungeons are even worse than the Divine Beasts. The fire and water temples in particular are just areas stuck together with no depth. The worst dungeons Zelda has ever had.- Sky Islands: Of all things, the main focus of the marketing is the weakest area in the entire game. It's more a question of how you get up there. Once you're up there, one of three copy-paste patterns awaits the player. Boring. On top of that, there is a pathetic variety of enemies up here. There are really only the small robots and maybe the occasional flying enemy.- Underground. Provides strong kicks for the first 3 hours. Then it becomes just as trivially boring as the Sky **** GO:- There's nothing worse for an open world than copying the world from the previous instalment and barely reworking it. There are caves, which are the best innovation on the surface. Everything else in the familiar open world is a bitter disappointment. Exploration is no fun. Worse still: where there was nothing in BotW, there is often nothing to be found in TotK either. So the open world degenerates even more into an Ubisoft junk world.TLDR: A masterpiece that fails due to its open world formula and doesn't make the most of its cool game design ideas.",

TotK is everything BotW was not, it's unrewarding, grindy, immersion-breaking, poorly written, trend-chasing, un-interactive, and, frankly, stupid. \n\nThe core gameplay loop of exploration doesn't work without a world designed for that exploration, that the player has not experienced and does not fully understand. That was BotW innovation. TotK fails to understand this on a fundamental level to such a degree that we might even start to think BotW was a fluke. \n\nBeyond that, TotK's new mechanics actually negatively impact BotW's other major innovation: world interaction. Because, you no longer have to think about the terrain when you can just Ascend past it all or build a flying machine to bypass it all. It's kind of amazing how little they considered BotW when making this game.\n\nThen, there's the story, which tries to pretend all other Zelda games never existed. BotW included, despite being a sequel. Never seen anything like it before, but it's awful.",

What happened to the 4 races of hyrule? What changed? As you explore the surface of Hyrule, you never run out of questions to ask. The depths, and the sky islands, nurture this constant sense of curiosity, drawing your eyes to them, perhaps not acting as second and third maps, but rather like additional locations on the original map, fueling your imagination and curiosity. While the rewards at the end of the trail these questions lead you on may not necessarily be the best or most useful, what is fulfilling is the journey, the act of travelling, the anticipation, and the discovery along the way itself. Along with the constant discovery and exploration, there were some of the highest highlights along the way. This game is the king of setting the mood. The sounds, the atmosphere, and the visuals of the Lightning Temple, Wind Temple and Fire Temple set the mood in the best way possible, getting you ready to take on the puzzles, enemies and bosses.\n\nThis game nails the *feeling* of exploration, wonder, and curiosity, enhanced by the gorgeous artstyle and mood setting. This, is what sets this game apart, and this is what makes this game a 10/10 for me, despite all its other shortcomings.",

Tears of the Kingdom is Breath of the Wild but better in almost every way. Breath of the Wild was already one of the greatest games ever made, and if this game is just that but improved and on a bigger scale with a brand new mechanic that completely re-invents the wheel, then what's not to love? The game has its flaws not because it isn't like Ocarina of Time in how it does its dungeons or story structure, instead I think ToTK's approach to dungeons are extremely valid and well-made, but it has its flaws due to some repetition in its world and poor writing in its story. Aside from that, Tears of the Kingdom is the best open world game we've seen to date.",

Direi che \u00e8 una bella sensazione.\nPer tutti quelli che criticano il fatto che sia troppo simile al predecessore io rispondo che secondo me va benissimo cos\u00ec e poi dobbiamo anche contare il fatto che TOTK si svolge subito dopo gli avvenimenti di BOTW quindi non \u00e8 che ci fosse tanto da poter cambiare. Quindi per concludere dico che TOTK \u00e8 un bellissimo gioco anche se non eguaglia BOTW.",

Those who think BOTW is better than TOTK are simply questioning a disruptive and innovative work with the judging framework of traditional games. If the next Zelda game regresses to the level of BOTW in terms of interactive richness, it is likely to succeed, but that will be a pity for the gaming world. Ironically, unlike what many people say, the world design of TOTK and BOTW simply look the same, and every corner is completely new in terms of experience. For people who can only play games on video media, there is probably nothing new about TOTK.",

    "quote": "This was the single greatest gaming experience I have ever had. The opening sequence immediately captured me and left me wanting more. once we gained full control, learning the new mechanics of the game was absolutely delightful. ultrahand especially was the most fun i've ever had learning. The moment the great sky island is finished, the game allows you complete freedom to explore and do whatever you wish. I loved visiting locations that were present in Breath Of the Wild and seeing how the developers changed it. My love for exploration also made traveling the depths one of the most fun parts of the game. there were a ton of mines where i dug up zonaite to upgrade my batteries and every now and then, my exploration would be rewarded with a side quest, or a neat piece of armor that referenced the older zelda games. I smiled from ear to ear upon finding my first piece of the twilight princess set. And the temples for the sages were all so much fun to play through. Especially the wind temple. The atmosphere, music, and dungeon puzzles in that dungeon made me realize that this game was everything I wanted it to be. It's also insane how you can try almost anything with ultrahand and things just work. I don't know how the hell the zelda team pulled off making a game like this work for the switch in just 6 years. the parallels the drew between Zelda and Ganondorf as determined individuals willing to sacrifice everything for their goal, as well as the connection between king Rauru's ideal of what it means to be a king compared to Ganondorf's were executed masterfully. This game was an emotional roller coaster.  Absolutely my favorite game of all time and a must play for anyone who calls themselves a gamer. Not to throw shade at any of the fantastic games that are nominated for GOTY 2023 but after playing them all it feels absolutely impossible that any game other than tears of the kingdom wins. Excellent work Hidemaro Fujibayashi and the rest of your team.",

Exploration, Characters, Worldbuilding, Crafting, Creativity. They successfully disrupted the open-world genre in the prequel, and they made it again in their crafting in this game.\n\nThe reason that I cannot give 10 is similar to Baldur Gate 3. They still have a lot of bugs since its launch (I said a lot since I see it myself in my playthrough and sometimes I cannot get past it), which is understandable since their feature is really big. It also has a minor UX where you cannot control your companion smoothly and disrupt the gameplay. This is the only thing that I see in this game.\n\nOtherwise, If you see the trailer and you want to play it, just buy it. Quality is over the price.",

Breath of the Wild had a sad ending due to the death of the champions but in Tears of the Kingdom despite the death of Mineru's spirit, the post-credits scene conveys joy and peace, defeating Ganondorf, his draconic form and saving to Zelda saving her from the fall and making her Hylian again.\n\nIn conclusion, Tears of the Kingdom surpassed its predecessor in many aspects, making it a totally unique open-world video game.",

The new areas and building on the old map is awesome, but occasionally some areas feel empty. The machine building and weapon crafting is fun as well, but the controls feel a little clunky. There's a tad bit too much when it comes to shrines and collectables, but those quests are mostly skipable if you don't want to do them  The item durability is less of an issue this time around, which was appreciated!

The uninspired narrative, lackluster visuals, poorly implemented open-world mechanics, and technical shortcomings collectively make Tears of the Kingdom the worst entry in the Zelda franchise, tarnishing the legacy of a series that has long been celebrated for its innovation, charm, and timeless appeal.",

I'm a long time Zelda fan and TOTK is now my favorite game of all times.\n\nIf you're a Zelda fan, you must play this game, if you've never played Zelda before, give this title a try, it can be the first Zelda experience you need, otherwise, try Skyward Sword and other 3D Zelda games first. \n\nTotk is definately a GOTY for me, or should I say GOTD/GOTG - game of the decade, game of the generation. \n\nHope you'll get the same incredible adventure I had with this game.",

Shrines, shrines and more shrines for boring rewards, a mostly dark new area full of emptiness and the same main world from the previous game made this a very underwhelming game and I cannot understand the high scores this is getting.",

    "quote": "I don\u2019t know where to start when I heard they were making a sequel of breath of the wild I was not excited at all I hated the very idea of this game because I thought Nintendo was just trying to make a quick money grab because breath of the wild was so successful so I thought this game was going to be mediocre at best. I was not hyped at all for this game. But when it released, I just bought it so I could give it a try and man was I wrong about it, They really put everything into this game. I think this is breath of the wild, truly realized this might sound like a stretch, but it might be the legend of Zelda truly realize with the overwhelmingly huge map, the freedom on how to play the game, the story, and links new abilities This game takes game of the year. Yes the frame rate is bad but and it doesn\u2019t perform like a next gen game should but that\u2019s not what makes a game a game I mean look at Minecraft it\u2019s considered the greatest game of all time yet its graphics are terrible graphics don\u2019t matter and frame rate doesn\u2019t matter either yeah don\u2019t get me wrong though I played spider man 2 and that game has some crispy visuals and I wish totk did run at 60 frames but that should not hold this game back form being game of the year it\u2019s about what you do in the game itself in tears of the Kingdom you can approach any situation in your own unique way for example, you don\u2019t have to draw your sword to kill enemies. You can create a car that has a Canon attached to it and below enemies up from a distance, or attach a flamethrower to your shield to burn your enemies while also protecting your self  there is literally endless ways to go about the game and that\u2019s scratching the surface and I\u2019m not exaggerating. This game is overwhelmingly huge this game will reward your from being curious and taking risks and I can not count how many times I stumbled on a key item or powerful upgrade just because I was curious about a location or something interesting I saw in the distance like I got go important items in that game on accident because I was just messing around in the open world and that\u2019s how an open world games is supposed to be you should be encouraged to be experimental and curious There\u2019s so much to do in this game. The story is also better than breath of the wild in my opinion, because the stories one big mystery and you have to put the pieces together or not it\u2019s completely optional if you what know to know secrets and lore details that game gives your nothing you gotta go out there and get it yourself and that\u2019s a great thing solving puzzle's has so much freedom to it there\u2019s not jut  way to solve a puzzle there are multiple ways to solve one puzzle out of hundreds you\u2019ll face, in most games puzzles are linear. There\u2019s only one way to solve them and that\u2019s not a bad thing, but totk gives the player the freedom to solve a puzzle in your unique way it\u2019s amazing sorry I know that sounds corny and it\u2019s OK if this game doesn\u2019t win game of the year I\u2019m just happy I was able to play it I have 160 hours in and I\u2019m ready to play 160 more. I know this was like an essay so if you made it this far, thank you for reading. I really appreciate it and have a wonderful day and I hope you\u2019re having just as much fun on thismarvelous game as I am.",

It takes everything BOTW was and tops it. \n\nUltrahand is the greatest gaming mechanic ever made. It adds an unprecedented level of creativity and interactivity. There\u2019s nothing more fun or engaging than designing a machine, device, or item to accomplish or reach something. It along with fuse lead the list that adds up to the best set of abilities Zelda has ever had. \n\nIt\u2019s almost inconceivable that arguably the most massive open world game ever made was pulled off on such obsolete hardware with so little compromises. The graphics are somehow immersive and fantastic as a result of Nintendo\u2019s doctorate in cartoon worlds and knowing what makes graphics look good and bad. With that said, I\u2019d still love to see what Nintendo could do with identical hardware to PS5 and Series X. \n\nI spent over 700 hours on this game because I didn\u2019t want it to end and because there\u2019s that much to do in it. \n\nMy only real complaints are that the coordinates should\u2019ve had a movable reticle that shows it\u2019s locations rather than yours, the hero\u2019s quest tracker was too short and should\u2019ve been limitless, that the game could have had a more organized and extensive tracking of true 100% completion and central hub featuring several hundred categories (you can add hundreds of hours to a game by simply creating more to complete), the lack of a meter that shows a weapon\u2019s or shield\u2019s degradation, and the main dungeons should\u2019ve been self contained and lengthier. All that said, as I noted above it\u2019s so good it makes these complaints completely irrelevant. \n\nAt the end of the day, like BOTW it\u2019s as good as gaming gets and further proof Nintendo is untouchable when it comes to game design. I just hate that there\u2019s such an extensive wait in between titles. If only gaming had the same delivery time as TV shows. Imagine a world where we get one Zelda per year or every other year.",

Its very essence seems to be woven from the threads of fantasy, where every glimmering tear that graces its landscapes tells a tale of unparalleled wonder.Picture a realm where emerald-green meadows stretch out like a welcoming carpet, kissed by the golden rays of a perpetually setting sun. Flowers of every hue bloom in harmonious symphony, reflecting the vibrancy of life that pulses through this fantastical kingdom. The air is infused with a fragrance so sweet, it is said to be the essence of the tears shed by the princess in the ancient **** the heart of the Kingdom of Tears stands a palace of mesmerizing beauty, its spires reaching toward the heavens. It is here that the tragic love story unfolds\u2014a narrative of star-crossed lovers whose passion transcends the boundaries of time. The tears shed by the princess, crystallized in the kingdom's stones, glisten like diamonds, casting a radiant glow that bathes the entire realm in an otherworldly **** day gives way to night, the Kingdom of Tears transforms into a celestial masterpiece. The tears, now illuminated by the silvery light of the moon, create a spectacle that leaves visitors breathless. It is a realm where fantasy and reality converge, and the echoes of the princess's lament become a hauntingly beautiful melody that lingers in the air.Travelers who venture into the Kingdom of Tears find themselves bewitched by its spell, not merely by its visual splendors but by the palpable sense of magic that permeates every corner. It is a place where dreams are born, and where the very air seems to shimmer with the promise of **** the grand tapestry of Seldara's legends, the Kingdom of Tears emerges as a jewel\u2014a beacon of beauty, resilience, and the enduring power of love. It invites all who dare to dream to step into its embrace and be transported to a realm where tears are not just symbols of sorrow but also tokens of a love that defies the boundaries of time and reality.",

    "quote": "For Tears of the Kingdom, my experience playing through the game has been bad.  I have nothing against TotK using the same map as BotW but with 2 added landscape to explore, the sky and depths.  Exploring the world of TotK seems rewarding at first, but it starts getting old too fast and the only reward is just seeing the sites.  You still have to find hundreds of Korok seeds to expand your weapon, bows, and shields inventories to functional levels.  There are physical dungeons, but they don't hold the charm as the traditional Zelda games achieved.\n\nThe most important factors of any game is the content and how you play in it.  The content is more quantity than quality.  The gameplay feels good if you have plenty of resources to burn through.  Finding great weapons is a bit more difficult in TotK than BotW due to new mechanics from the Zonai technology.  To incentivize using the fusion mechanic, weapons have lower durability than they had in BotW.  As long as you have decent fusion material, you can make \"decent\" weapons, but for me, that fusion material pool is used for too much, and this led to terrible experiences with combat.  If I want a better time dealing with tough encounters, it involved spending hours in the depths farming for bombs and materials.\n\nOverall, the game play is more punishing than Dark Souls type games.  If this is the future of Zelda games, the series is doomed.",

    "quote": "Virtually flawless. The Legend of Zelda benefits from one fact that many titles as of late have been neglecting. It is a video game FIRST, and a dang good one at that. Tears of the Kingdom fully embraces its vast world of discovery, mystery, and treasure in ways that seemed impossible before. Its story is even more compelling than its predecessor, your new abilities are game-altering with tons of player-agency, and the world is somehow even more massive and ACTUALLY FILLED WITH THINGS TO DO than it was before. Though its performance leaves a lot to be desired on the docked version of the Switch, that says more about the console than it does the game itself. This is a $70 game that is truly worth its asking price. 10/10!",

I cannot believe what these guys at Nintendo did on this weak handheld console, only one word can describe it: revolutionary.",

Over 152 shrines to explore. 40 hearts to explore and you also have to get 3 bars of stamina to obtain too. And you also need to obtain the master sword which you will get futher on to the game. And the story is very dark and messed up for a Zelda game but you\u2019re ready for the dark and wicked moblins that will want to grab your snacks and your soda. grab them and grab your Switch as you will explore a world of darkness and light as you will see clash against one another inside your tv screen handheld device and enjoy the open world view of hyrule once again.",

The change of Magnesis where you can only move magnetic items to Ultrahand where you can move any free item is great. Each playthrough is unique and there is so much to explore. So much to explore is the only downside. (Also the sages abilities, I MISS YOU REVALI'S GALE). You might be thinking to yourself \"How is too much exploration a downside?\". The reason is that you need an online guide if you want to get 100%. Finding everything on your own would take years. Love this game, 10/10.",

The side quests are more fun as well. Combat has quality of life improvements. The hand abilities are a lot better than BotW's shekiah slate powers. Ultrahand lets me mess around in all kinds of new ways, like driving across large stretches of land, and kill monsters in new ways. Fuse fixed the weapon durability problem. There is one weakness in gameplay: the sage abilities are more gimmicky and less practical (exception being the wind one). The story is an improvement over BotW (mainly due to the tear memories, rather than Link's own quest) but still a bit lacking. The dungeons are decent, with proper elemental themes returning, as well as unique bosses (rather than the boring Blight Ganons in BotW). The finale is pure greatness, and Ganondorf has had his best showing to date.",

In terms of story, it is miles deeper than breath of the wild but dosent shove lore and story down your throat. The new abilities are great, like making Zonai creations or reversing an object back at the enemy. The map is better too with the ability to explore the skies and the depths. However, I think this game will not have the same effect as it's predesscor due to it being maybe \"too similar\" by many.",

However, Tears Of The Kingdom undoubtedly improves on virtually every single aspect of the game, from the core gameplay its self, to minor details within the game, truly defining it as the greatest game OF ALL TIME. \n\nFirstly, Tears of the Kingdom drastically improves upon the dungeons seem within Breath Of The Wild. Although the divine beasts were very good, they felt repetitive, and each one felt like a slight reskin of the other. However, in Tears Of The Kingdom we see a more traditional and unique style to the temples, each fitting their respective areas. The lightning temple, a prime example of how great the temples are, feels much more like a traditional dungeon with rooms throughout the dungeon connecting to each other to form a sensational sequence of puzzles to finish the temple. Furthermore, the journey to the temple itself is sensational, truly setting up the marvel of the temple to come. To further improve upon BOTW, the bosses are drastically improved. The fights are thrilling, entertaining and truly enhance the dungeon further. They are completely unique which makes it feel all the more special. \n\nSecondly, the new abilities introduced truly enhance the gaming experience. Firstly, fuse is essential to fixing the durability problem. Instead of looking for the weapons themselves, fuse allows us to create our own weapons which mean that we are focused upon the materials not the weapons. Ascend allows us to efficiently ascend through ceilings, hills, caves in order to reach another place, almost like revali\u2019s gale. Recall is just out-right amazing. And ultra hand completely revolutionises Tears Of The Kingdom. It allows us to create and tackle the game in what ever way we want, eradication the linear aspect to any puzzle and the game in general. It brings the players imagination to life and truly changes the gameplay experience, making it better than ever. \n\nThirdly, the story of TOTK is more in-depth and meaningful than before. Characters like Zelda are more developed and truly feel essential to the plot. It is all a mystery at first, and engages the reader as we slowly unveil the mystery. And, of course, the introduction of Ganondorf is genius, adding a deceitful, thrilling and powerful antagonist to the plot and giving us the greatest Zelda boss fight ever, and the greatest cinematic ending to a game in history. \n\nFinally, the introduction of the sky Islands and The Depths eradicate the emptiness of breath of the Wild and give us a more jam packed Hyrule. Everywhere you go, there is always a new puzzle, challenge or mystery to the game, perfecting the open world genre. \n\nTears Of The Kingdom doesn\u2019t revolutionise open world gaming, but perfects it and improves upon one the greatest games of all time. It is truly a masterpiece and a must get for any player of any console.",

Unfortunately, the gameplay does get boring and repetitive quickly, especially if you played BOTW. \n\nIf you were questioning wether you needed to play the prequel before this, the answer is NO most definitely not, go straight to TOTK and never look back!\n\nPLAY AND JUDGE",

Tears of the Kingdom's gameplay, despite borrowing plenty from it's predecessor, Breath of the Wild, expands on the amazing foundation with amazing gameplay, a world that is still fun to explore and satisfying puzzles.\n\nHowever, the game's story fails to satisfy is many areas, the memories, unlike Breath of the Wild, are intended to be viewed in a certain order, which is not made clear to the player. This leads to the story being extremely boring and predicable if you view it in any way other than what is intended. The dungeons, while a vast upgrade from that of Breath of the Wild, have unsatisfying pay offs with all 4 being largely the same. This is a shame, as the series is largely known for it's grande and amazing stories. \n\nHowever, the story is still better than many other game, and the new features such as the depths provide many hours of exploration and enjoyment. However, the sky, shown all across advertising, failed to impress, as many are mere copies of each other and the are too disconnected from each other outside of the tutorial area.\n\nHighly recommend, as it is a game where the flaws simply do not outweigh the extraordinary majority of the game",

    "quote": "Hmm, so where to start. It's not bad as a game, if you never played Breath of the Wild. Story would have been better if they just started over, \"like always\". Well, ok. It works. The world? Huge. The map is now in three layers, all about the same size as the map in BotW. Game play? Hmm, weeeeell it's basically the same as BotW but with some small changes (and larger changes that you don't really need). It feels more like a DLC or even a MOD than a new stand-alone game. Would I recommend it? Yes and no. Buy it on sale, but we all know Nintendo doesn't do sale on big games.",

There's too much dialogue, the UI ****, the sky islands are barren, the cutscenes for the dungeons are boring, etc. etc. etc. But all these flaws completely fail to ruin my experience with the game. \n\nThis game gave me an emotion that no other game could have given me. I don't want to do a spoiler review but I can write so much about it. Some of my favorite moments in not only Zelda but gaming history, come from this game and it took me 150 hours to finally decide to fight Ganon. And the ending was... simply fantastic.\n\nMaybe I'm biased or my love for the franchise blinds me to its flaws, but I have not had this much fun with a game since Mario Odyssey nor Celeste.\n\nI don't want to write more. Just know, there are critiques one could give the game, but the highest of highs remain here and I wouldn't trade this experience for anything.\n\nI wondered before what Breath of the Wild was missing when I played that game. It wasn't the weaker abilities; it wasn't the lackluster ending; it wasn't the empty Hyrule. It was one thing: a heart. The charisma and wit of Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, and Skyward Sword were missing in Breath of the Wild. This game has it.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom... has it all. If they just tweaked a few more things and I'd give this a perfect rating",

In many ways it is the game BoTW should have been.\n\nI almost see BoTW as a sort of beta version of ToTK. It is as if the creation of the open world and game mechanics took so much time and resources that the developers did not have time to actually fill the world with content or a story. With ToTK I feel like the mechanics and open world concept was already developed, so now they were able to focus solely on filling the world with content and a richer storyline. \n\nToTK is a true pleasure to play. It is a great game with lots of fun and so much to explore.",

Unfortunately, there is a lot to discuss in it's repetitiveness and over time, it does become boring. Little reward for discovering everything not to mention the grind. Biggest complaints, barren sky and underground, overall game play is easy, cooking and clothing become fairly useless as most of it doesnt do anything that is actually needed to complete the game, and worst of all the very short and low difficulty in the dungeons. I would go for a smaller world that has more content, or missions that give meaningful rewards or add to the \"must do's\" to move forward or access other new content . So the game gets a 7 because it's not fair to score too low because it is well-made, but definitely not a 10 because it is not far off from breath of the wild.",

For me as a Genshin Impact player, this is easily the same as exploring the world again just like when I explored Teyvat back when Genshin first launched, the difference here is I played as Link, the infamous protagonist of Zelda series rather than choosing between two genders like in many other game (Genshin Impact, Honkai Star Rail, Tower of Fantasy and so on). I quickly adapt into the world legend of Zelda (of course with the help of communities posts and walkthroughs) and I find that ToTK have its own unique system that makes it different from BoTW. Though, I'd say that my way of playing is reversed. If anyone wants to start playing Zelda in Nintendo switch, the correct order is BoTW then ToTK since they just differs in timeline.",

As for the soundtrack, it is beter (in my opinion) and I am glad the tamples feel like dounges, I didn't hate the divine beast but let's be real who wants them back. And here comes the critisizam, the abilities are trash, they are not terable but compeare to botw they are bad, I don't even use them like at all, BUT it's not that bad, they can be useful sometimes. But man the amount of stuf you can do is INSANE, you want to go thru walls, you can, you want to build almost anything your stupid brain thinks of, you can, you want to fuse wepont with anything you find, you can.",

You find a shrine, it is a puzzle, to get korok seeds solve a puzzle, even finding out what to do for quests are puzzles. Even boss fights are puzzle and I hated that. Dude let me fight these mfs normally but no first you have to shoot its eye and then you can deal the damage, no you have beat 3 heads first and then you can deal the damage, otherwise they are just spamming their **** and they dont give you proper time to deal some damage. The most fair fights are lynels and they are fun and challenging. The others are just feel like you are solving puzzle over and over again and I am sick of it. Give me proper boss fights. Another problem is armor. I upgraded my armor to the highest and I didn't see the difference and it's same with weapons. At the beginning of the game I was wearing weapons with 10-15 attack and after some time it increased to 50 but I still didn't feel the difference. It didn't make me feel like, oh this weapon is strong... So this kind of things killed the mood for me... And to be honest, I feel bored 80% of the time. Because the game mechanics that are supposed to entertain you are just puzzles. Even the action itself is a puzzle, but it is supposed to be dynamic.\nAnyway that's the all the complains that I have. But I understand why it has such a high score and people think it is a masterpiece and all but it is not like that for me, still a great game though.",

The ultrahand ability is super impressive, the ascend ability was a genius addition, and the fuse mechanic gives meaning to the weapon durability. Dungeons are improved but still not at the level of classic Zelda titles. Though I loved Totk it disappointed me in a few ways. I believe using the same map was a mistake. The core formula has already become stale as it is basically identical to BotW. Totk does basically nothing to address the many of the problems discovered in BotW. While I\u2019m very impressed by what Totk has accomplished, I know that the future of Zelda must recognize its loyal \u201cclassic\u201d fans in order to maintain its status as one of the greatest gaming series. The Zelda team should analyze why some Zelda fans are worried for the franchise\u2019s future.",

This includes a better story and more interesting side quests. Second, the action possiblity are so much more satisfying. Ultrahand, fuse, and ascend open up so many possibilities and allow for creativity. This makes moving around the map and solving puzzles much more satisfying. Third, it maintains the feeling of tranquility and beauty.\nI am giving this a 9 for now, but only because I want to play some more before I proclaim it as a 10/10 masterpiece.

All the Chests you get, have useless stuff in them, just another batch of bow/sword/shield... put them to the 50 other ones in your inventory. Having to walk to my next destination scared me more than Ganondorf and his lackeys and you know whats worse? now you get the same empty useless world in the sky and in the depths.\nThe Whole game felt like a chore to play. Just finished it at around 65h, not gonna continue or play the sidequests.\n\nPro:\n- Crafting variety is huge, some ppl will love to build machines etc. (not me)\n- gameplay is nice, swordplay and bow etc. is great\n-love the coloring of the game\n- interesting characters including both mcs and villain\n\ncon:\n- cant call your horse from more than 20 meters. not gonna buy any dlc for that tbh, nintendo has to learn to build in quality of life features (they are probably scared that it would cut the playtime short if you were on horseback all the time)\n- weapon durability\n- weapons overall,  mastersword is probably the biggest joke ever.\nthe only good weapons in the game are either limited or have big debuffs... is that supposed to be fun?\n- tedious sidequests, like unlocking the fairies for equipment enchancment (they should beat the guy up who came up with that idea)\n- equipment enchancement costs too much, 4x upgradeable, costs 10, 50, 200, 500, so760 just for 1 piece + rare materials (so selling them is not an option, they should also beat up that guy, but is probably the same dude), 2280 rupees for just 1 set of clothing to max and there are above 15 or so sets.\n- farming money/rupees is almost impossible and goes too slow, quests reward you max with 300, the gems are way to scarce and are needed for upgrading or weapon buff\n- shrines are harder to find compared to botw, wasnt fun to look for them, not gonna open a gameguide for that\n- depths are just pure suffering. cant see more than 5 meters ahead, gloom everywhere and mobs that either put gloom on you or oneshot you... the whole idea is nice but the realization is so bad.\n- Dragontear quests should be fixed, so that you get the videos in order, mine were all over the place. so i was confused till i stopped playing and watched the whole video in order on youtube. that way i could spoil myself and also have atleast some clue what was going on\n- damage scaling is very bad. i was hitting like a truck with my 70+ dmg weapon but still couldnt scratch the silver class monsters, burned many good weapons on some random mobs\n- the game is trying too hard to be mysterious .. i dont want to explore everything, give me a clear line, show me where i have to go, where i can find the caves etc., the world is too big and everything looks similar so i dont wanna go to most of those places and explore them\n\ni enjoyed the game but it had moments where i absolutely hated it.\ni am glad that i played it, but i will def not preorder the next zelda title thankts to this game",

The previous game had a complaint of Ganon being too easy and that is not the case in TOTK. Overall the building mechanic is great and a welcome addition to the world. The only downside in my opinion is the game overstays its welcome slightly. You have to do something major before fighting Ganon that drags out the story another 5 hours. Other than that the game is a must play imo.",

    "quote": "It irons out almost all of BotW's weaknesses.GOOD:- Gigantic open world with lots of secrets and unique caves.- A comprehensible story with an epic climax, albeit very predictable.- GANONDORF IS BACK! The final battle is epic, but simple. This is probably the way to pick up casuals and veterans alike.- The skills! Weaponfuse as well as building vehicles is great! Crafting weapons in particular is great fun. There aren't too many special fusions in the end, but it solves the problem that BotW still had. Battles are motivating. You are well rewarded and make noticeable progress without a level system.AVERAGE:- Timeback Skill - is very helpful, but also necessary in places to rewind the far-flying parts that didn't land where you physically expected them to.- Bosses - they're still not as good as they were in previous Zelda instalments, but better than the Ganon fights in ****:- Enemy Variation. BotW already had few enemies, but TotK simply has too few enemies for a game in 2023. Only a handful of new ones have been added. I would have liked more creative enemies here, especially because of Weaponfuse.- Dungeons. Someone says that the great dungeons of the good Zelda days have returned. I can't confirm that. The 4 story dungeons are even worse than the Divine Beasts. The fire and water temples in particular are just areas stuck together with no depth. The worst dungeons Zelda has ever had.- Sky Islands: Of all things, the main focus of the marketing is the weakest area in the entire game. It's more a question of how you get up there. Once you're up there, one of three copy-paste patterns awaits the player. Boring. On top of that, there is a pathetic variety of enemies up here. There are really only the small robots and maybe the occasional flying enemy.- Underground. Provides strong kicks for the first 3 hours. Then it becomes just as trivially boring as the Sky **** GO:- There's nothing worse for an open world than copying the world from the previous instalment and barely reworking it. There are caves, which are the best innovation on the surface. Everything else in the familiar open world is a bitter disappointment. Exploration is no fun. Worse still: where there was nothing in BotW, there is often nothing to be found in TotK either. So the open world degenerates even more into an Ubisoft junk world.TLDR: A masterpiece that fails due to its open world formula and doesn't make the most of its cool game design ideas.",

TotK is everything BotW was not, it's unrewarding, grindy, immersion-breaking, poorly written, trend-chasing, un-interactive, and, frankly, stupid. \n\nThe core gameplay loop of exploration doesn't work without a world designed for that exploration, that the player has not experienced and does not fully understand. That was BotW innovation. TotK fails to understand this on a fundamental level to such a degree that we might even start to think BotW was a fluke. \n\nBeyond that, TotK's new mechanics actually negatively impact BotW's other major innovation: world interaction. Because, you no longer have to think about the terrain when you can just Ascend past it all or build a flying machine to bypass it all. It's kind of amazing how little they considered BotW when making this game.\n\nThen, there's the story, which tries to pretend all other Zelda games never existed. BotW included, despite being a sequel. Never seen anything like it before, but it's awful.",

What happened to the 4 races of hyrule? What changed? As you explore the surface of Hyrule, you never run out of questions to ask. The depths, and the sky islands, nurture this constant sense of curiosity, drawing your eyes to them, perhaps not acting as second and third maps, but rather like additional locations on the original map, fueling your imagination and curiosity. While the rewards at the end of the trail these questions lead you on may not necessarily be the best or most useful, what is fulfilling is the journey, the act of travelling, the anticipation, and the discovery along the way itself. Along with the constant discovery and exploration, there were some of the highest highlights along the way. This game is the king of setting the mood. The sounds, the atmosphere, and the visuals of the Lightning Temple, Wind Temple and Fire Temple set the mood in the best way possible, getting you ready to take on the puzzles, enemies and bosses.\n\nThis game nails the *feeling* of exploration, wonder, and curiosity, enhanced by the gorgeous artstyle and mood setting. This, is what sets this game apart, and this is what makes this game a 10/10 for me, despite all its other shortcomings.",

Tears of the Kingdom is Breath of the Wild but better in almost every way. Breath of the Wild was already one of the greatest games ever made, and if this game is just that but improved and on a bigger scale with a brand new mechanic that completely re-invents the wheel, then what's not to love? The game has its flaws not because it isn't like Ocarina of Time in how it does its dungeons or story structure, instead I think ToTK's approach to dungeons are extremely valid and well-made, but it has its flaws due to some repetition in its world and poor writing in its story. Aside from that, Tears of the Kingdom is the best open world game we've seen to date.",

Direi che \u00e8 una bella sensazione.\nPer tutti quelli che criticano il fatto che sia troppo simile al predecessore io rispondo che secondo me va benissimo cos\u00ec e poi dobbiamo anche contare il fatto che TOTK si svolge subito dopo gli avvenimenti di BOTW quindi non \u00e8 che ci fosse tanto da poter cambiare. Quindi per concludere dico che TOTK \u00e8 un bellissimo gioco anche se non eguaglia BOTW.",

Those who think BOTW is better than TOTK are simply questioning a disruptive and innovative work with the judging framework of traditional games. If the next Zelda game regresses to the level of BOTW in terms of interactive richness, it is likely to succeed, but that will be a pity for the gaming world. Ironically, unlike what many people say, the world design of TOTK and BOTW simply look the same, and every corner is completely new in terms of experience. For people who can only play games on video media, there is probably nothing new about TOTK.",

    "quote": "This was the single greatest gaming experience I have ever had. The opening sequence immediately captured me and left me wanting more. once we gained full control, learning the new mechanics of the game was absolutely delightful. ultrahand especially was the most fun i've ever had learning. The moment the great sky island is finished, the game allows you complete freedom to explore and do whatever you wish. I loved visiting locations that were present in Breath Of the Wild and seeing how the developers changed it. My love for exploration also made traveling the depths one of the most fun parts of the game. there were a ton of mines where i dug up zonaite to upgrade my batteries and every now and then, my exploration would be rewarded with a side quest, or a neat piece of armor that referenced the older zelda games. I smiled from ear to ear upon finding my first piece of the twilight princess set. And the temples for the sages were all so much fun to play through. Especially the wind temple. The atmosphere, music, and dungeon puzzles in that dungeon made me realize that this game was everything I wanted it to be. It's also insane how you can try almost anything with ultrahand and things just work. I don't know how the hell the zelda team pulled off making a game like this work for the switch in just 6 years. the parallels the drew between Zelda and Ganondorf as determined individuals willing to sacrifice everything for their goal, as well as the connection between king Rauru's ideal of what it means to be a king compared to Ganondorf's were executed masterfully. This game was an emotional roller coaster.  Absolutely my favorite game of all time and a must play for anyone who calls themselves a gamer. Not to throw shade at any of the fantastic games that are nominated for GOTY 2023 but after playing them all it feels absolutely impossible that any game other than tears of the kingdom wins. Excellent work Hidemaro Fujibayashi and the rest of your team.",

Exploration, Characters, Worldbuilding, Crafting, Creativity. They successfully disrupted the open-world genre in the prequel, and they made it again in their crafting in this game.\n\nThe reason that I cannot give 10 is similar to Baldur Gate 3. They still have a lot of bugs since its launch (I said a lot since I see it myself in my playthrough and sometimes I cannot get past it), which is understandable since their feature is really big. It also has a minor UX where you cannot control your companion smoothly and disrupt the gameplay. This is the only thing that I see in this game.\n\nOtherwise, If you see the trailer and you want to play it, just buy it. Quality is over the price.",

Breath of the Wild had a sad ending due to the death of the champions but in Tears of the Kingdom despite the death of Mineru's spirit, the post-credits scene conveys joy and peace, defeating Ganondorf, his draconic form and saving to Zelda saving her from the fall and making her Hylian again.\n\nIn conclusion, Tears of the Kingdom surpassed its predecessor in many aspects, making it a totally unique open-world video game.",

The new areas and building on the old map is awesome, but occasionally some areas feel empty. The machine building and weapon crafting is fun as well, but the controls feel a little clunky. There's a tad bit too much when it comes to shrines and collectables, but those quests are mostly skipable if you don't want to do them  The item durability is less of an issue this time around, which was appreciated!

The uninspired narrative, lackluster visuals, poorly implemented open-world mechanics, and technical shortcomings collectively make Tears of the Kingdom the worst entry in the Zelda franchise, tarnishing the legacy of a series that has long been celebrated for its innovation, charm, and timeless appeal.",

I'm a long time Zelda fan and TOTK is now my favorite game of all times.\n\nIf you're a Zelda fan, you must play this game, if you've never played Zelda before, give this title a try, it can be the first Zelda experience you need, otherwise, try Skyward Sword and other 3D Zelda games first. \n\nTotk is definately a GOTY for me, or should I say GOTD/GOTG - game of the decade, game of the generation. \n\nHope you'll get the same incredible adventure I had with this game.",

Shrines, shrines and more shrines for boring rewards, a mostly dark new area full of emptiness and the same main world from the previous game made this a very underwhelming game and I cannot understand the high scores this is getting.",

    "quote": "I don\u2019t know where to start when I heard they were making a sequel of breath of the wild I was not excited at all I hated the very idea of this game because I thought Nintendo was just trying to make a quick money grab because breath of the wild was so successful so I thought this game was going to be mediocre at best. I was not hyped at all for this game. But when it released, I just bought it so I could give it a try and man was I wrong about it, They really put everything into this game. I think this is breath of the wild, truly realized this might sound like a stretch, but it might be the legend of Zelda truly realize with the overwhelmingly huge map, the freedom on how to play the game, the story, and links new abilities This game takes game of the year. Yes the frame rate is bad but and it doesn\u2019t perform like a next gen game should but that\u2019s not what makes a game a game I mean look at Minecraft it\u2019s considered the greatest game of all time yet its graphics are terrible graphics don\u2019t matter and frame rate doesn\u2019t matter either yeah don\u2019t get me wrong though I played spider man 2 and that game has some crispy visuals and I wish totk did run at 60 frames but that should not hold this game back form being game of the year it\u2019s about what you do in the game itself in tears of the Kingdom you can approach any situation in your own unique way for example, you don\u2019t have to draw your sword to kill enemies. You can create a car that has a Canon attached to it and below enemies up from a distance, or attach a flamethrower to your shield to burn your enemies while also protecting your self  there is literally endless ways to go about the game and that\u2019s scratching the surface and I\u2019m not exaggerating. This game is overwhelmingly huge this game will reward your from being curious and taking risks and I can not count how many times I stumbled on a key item or powerful upgrade just because I was curious about a location or something interesting I saw in the distance like I got go important items in that game on accident because I was just messing around in the open world and that\u2019s how an open world games is supposed to be you should be encouraged to be experimental and curious There\u2019s so much to do in this game. The story is also better than breath of the wild in my opinion, because the stories one big mystery and you have to put the pieces together or not it\u2019s completely optional if you what know to know secrets and lore details that game gives your nothing you gotta go out there and get it yourself and that\u2019s a great thing solving puzzle's has so much freedom to it there\u2019s not jut  way to solve a puzzle there are multiple ways to solve one puzzle out of hundreds you\u2019ll face, in most games puzzles are linear. There\u2019s only one way to solve them and that\u2019s not a bad thing, but totk gives the player the freedom to solve a puzzle in your unique way it\u2019s amazing sorry I know that sounds corny and it\u2019s OK if this game doesn\u2019t win game of the year I\u2019m just happy I was able to play it I have 160 hours in and I\u2019m ready to play 160 more. I know this was like an essay so if you made it this far, thank you for reading. I really appreciate it and have a wonderful day and I hope you\u2019re having just as much fun on thismarvelous game as I am.",

It takes everything BOTW was and tops it. \n\nUltrahand is the greatest gaming mechanic ever made. It adds an unprecedented level of creativity and interactivity. There\u2019s nothing more fun or engaging than designing a machine, device, or item to accomplish or reach something. It along with fuse lead the list that adds up to the best set of abilities Zelda has ever had. \n\nIt\u2019s almost inconceivable that arguably the most massive open world game ever made was pulled off on such obsolete hardware with so little compromises. The graphics are somehow immersive and fantastic as a result of Nintendo\u2019s doctorate in cartoon worlds and knowing what makes graphics look good and bad. With that said, I\u2019d still love to see what Nintendo could do with identical hardware to PS5 and Series X. \n\nI spent over 700 hours on this game because I didn\u2019t want it to end and because there\u2019s that much to do in it. \n\nMy only real complaints are that the coordinates should\u2019ve had a movable reticle that shows it\u2019s locations rather than yours, the hero\u2019s quest tracker was too short and should\u2019ve been limitless, that the game could have had a more organized and extensive tracking of true 100% completion and central hub featuring several hundred categories (you can add hundreds of hours to a game by simply creating more to complete), the lack of a meter that shows a weapon\u2019s or shield\u2019s degradation, and the main dungeons should\u2019ve been self contained and lengthier. All that said, as I noted above it\u2019s so good it makes these complaints completely irrelevant. \n\nAt the end of the day, like BOTW it\u2019s as good as gaming gets and further proof Nintendo is untouchable when it comes to game design. I just hate that there\u2019s such an extensive wait in between titles. If only gaming had the same delivery time as TV shows. Imagine a world where we get one Zelda per year or every other year.",

There is just no soul in this Game anymore. An almost Empty World. And no Items like they used to be. But now we can glue a Rock to a Stick. Wow. I can only hope they make a real Game sometime in the Future again.",
